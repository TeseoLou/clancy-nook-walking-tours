## Introduction

## User Experience (UX)
User experience (UX) design focuses on creating meaningful, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and a product or service. For a website, this means designing a platform that meets users’ needs while providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

Prioritising user experience is essential to ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the site, achieve their goals, and enjoy the process. This philosophy is particularly relevant to the Clancy Nook website, where the goal is to cater to a diverse audience of locals, tourists, and corporate clients.

### Strategy
The **Strategy Plane** in UX design forms the foundation of any project by aligning business goals with user needs. It addresses fundamental questions about what the website aims to achieve and how it delivers value to its users. 

For Clancy Nook, this meant not only creating an online presence but also ensuring the site serves as a seamless gateway for users to learn about, book, and engage with the historic walking tours offered. The strategy plane was the first port of call in the development process, as it established the overall purpose of the site and guided all subsequent design and development decisions.

By starting with the strategy, the project focused on identifying key objectives—such as enhancing visibility, streamlining booking processes, and showcasing the unique value of the tours—and balancing these with the needs of diverse user groups like tourists, locals, and corporate clients. This foundational step ensured that every feature and design element served a clear purpose, meeting both user expectations and business ambitions.

#### **Initial Discussion**
The development process for the Clancy Nook website began with an in-depth meeting with the client, Louis Cane. During this discussion, we explored key aspects of the business, including:
- The primary goals for the business and the website.
- Insights into Clancy Nook’s current operations, including its use of Linktree, TripAdvisor,  and Eventbrite.
- Current clientele and future clientele.
- Future Goals to expand the business by attracting more corporate clients and building partnerships with community organizations. 

#### **Business Goals**
The following business goals were established for the Clancy Nook website during the initial discussion phase. These goals emerged from a collaborative dialogue with the client, focusing on both immediate needs and aspirations for the future. While some goals centered on creating a strong digital presence and improving user experience, others reflected long-term ambitions, such as attracting corporate clients and collaborating with local communities.

Each business goal is paired with a corresponding call-to-action (CTA) designed to:
- Guide users toward desired actions such as booking a tour, learning more about the guide, or contacting for corporate inquiries.
- Make the website's purpose immediately clear to visitors.

Goals 6 and 7, while not central to the website's initial development, represent aspirational objectives for the business’s growth and social impact. By planting the seeds for these initiatives now, the site can evolve over time to accommodate these long-term ambitions.

#### **User Demographics**
Understanding attends and books Clancy Nook tours establishes clear user demographics, which permitted the identification of key user groups, their needs, and their motivations. These in turn informed the development of tailored user stories and features for the website. By analysing the clientele and tour attendance patterns, we could align the website's functionality and content with the expectations of the target audience. This ensured that every feature and piece of information on the site would resonate with its users and provide maximum value.

The demographics were broken down by tour type to account for the unique audience profiles each tour attracts:
- **City Center Tour:**
  - **60-70% Mancunians:** Local history enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of the city.
  - **20-30% Tourists or Visitors:** Out-of-town guests looking to explore Manchester's cultural and historical highlights.
  - **Diverse Audience Mix:** Includes families, students, and older adults.

- **Whalley Range Tour:**
  - **Majority Local Residents:** Individuals with a vested interest in the area's history or personal connections.
  - **New Residents:** Those wanting to learn about the neighborhood they now call home.
  - **Former Residents:** Occasional attendees revisiting for nostalgic reasons.

- **Ancoats Tour:**
  - **80-90% from the Wider Manchester Region:** Predominantly history enthusiasts who appreciate the industrial heritage of Ancoats.
  - **Currently Lacking Local Attendance:** Attracting Ancoats locals remains a growth area and a goal for the tour guide.

#### **Target Audiences**

The insights gathered from the demographic analysis and business goals allowed us to define the following target audiences for the Clancy Nook website. Each audience group aligns with specific business goals, helping to establish clear connections between user needs and the website's features.

1. **New Users - Prospective Customers:**  
   First-time visitors exploring Clancy Nook and seeking information about tours to decide on booking.

2. **Returning Users:**  
   Loyal customers looking for updates, new tours, and opportunities to engage further.

3. **Locals:**  
   Residents of Manchester or surrounding areas interested in deepening their connection to the city’s history.

6. **Community Leaders (Non-profits/Schools) - Prospective Customers:**  
   Organizations looking to collaborate with Clancy Nook for concession-priced or free educational tours tailored to their needs.

#### **User Stories** 
For this project, user stories developed capture the diverse needs of Clancy Nook’s target audience, ensuring the website provides a user-centric experience. The creation of user stories helped define what different user groups—such as locals, tourists, corporate clients, and returning users—expect from the website. These stories bridge the gap between user needs and the technical development process, ensuring every feature contributes to a positive user experience and serve as a roadmap for development and guiding design decisions. 
 
To ensure effective and timely delivery, the user stories were divided into three priority categories: **must-have**, **should-have**, and **could-have**. These categories reflect the essential, important, and desirable features for the website.

- **Must-Have** stories represent the core functionalities that the website cannot succeed without. These include fundamental aspects like clear navigation, booking instructions, contact form and reviews.  
- **Should-Have** stories include features that enhance the user experience and cater to specific user groups, such as social media links and private tour information.  
- **Could-Have** stories consist of advanced or supplementary features that, while not essential, would add extra value if implemented, such as downloadable brochures or storytelling audio clips.  

This prioritization ensures that critical features are developed first while leaving room for additional improvements based on time and resources.

#### **Emerging Website Components**
The analysis of user needs and expectations highlighted several critical components that would form the foundation of the Clancy Nook website. These components were designed to address the goals of both the business and its diverse user base, ensuring a user-friendly, informative, and engaging experience. Below are the core website components that emerged during the planning phase:
1. **About Section**  
   Including information about the guide’s historical knowledge and storytelling abilities emphasizes the unique value Clancy Nook offers, particularly appealing to locals and history enthusiasts.

2. **Tours Information**  
   Providing clear and accessible details about available tours, including themes, schedules, meeting points, and additional details, was identified as a top priority. This ensures users can quickly learn about the experiences offered.

3. **Booking Options**  
   A streamlined booking process via integrated links to Eventbrite, combined with a user-friendly contact form for bespoke inquiries, makes securing a spot on a tour simple and efficient.

4. **Contact Form**  
   A dedicated contact section provides users with an easy way to reach out for questions, inquiries about bespoke tours, or to request additional information, ensuring seamless communication.

5. **Transparent Pricing**  
   Highlighting pricing information, including the pay-what-you-can option, ensures users understand the cost of the tours. This transparency encourages bookings while showcasing Clancy Nook's accessibility for a wider audience.

6. **Group Booking Section**  
   Dedicated sections for corporate users and community leaders provide tailored information about private and group tours. This includes details on how these tours can be customized to meet specific needs, reinforcing the business’s appeal to a broader audience.

7. **Reviews Access**  
   Featuring testimonials and reviews from past attendees helps build credibility and trust, particularly for new users and locals seeking assurance of tour quality.

8. **Image Gallery**  
   A gallery showcasing images from past tours provides a visual representation of the experiences offered. This component is designed to engage tourists and returning users, giving them a sense of the atmosphere and storytelling that Clancy Nook tours provide.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   Social media links in the footer encourage users to stay connected with Clancy Nook, providing updates and opportunities to share their experiences. This fosters community engagement and increases the visibility of the tours.

10. **Supplementary Media**  
    Supplementary resources, such as downloadable PDFs or brochures for corporate and private tours, provide businesses with shareable materials to aid in internal planning. Additionally, audio or video snippets of the guide’s storytelling offer a unique preview of the experience for prospective customers, enticing them to book a tour.

#### **Importance/Feasibility**
The Importance/Feasibility analysis evaluates each website component based on two criteria: importance and feasibility. Importance refers to how critical the component is to achieving the business goals and addressing user needs outlined in the user stories. Feasibility, on the other hand, assesses the practicality of implementing the component within the project's constraints (e.g., timeline, resources, and technical expertise).

This analysis ensures that the development process prioritizes components that deliver the most value while remaining achievable. By striking this balance, the project remains focused and efficient, delivering the maximum possible impact within its constraints.

The table below rates each component on a scale of 1 to 5 for both importance and feasibility:
- **Importance:** A rating of **1** means the component has low relevance to business goals or user stories, while a **5** signifies that the component is essential.
- **Feasibility:** A rating of **1** indicates that the component is difficult to implement within the project's constraints, while a **5** means it is straightforward to achieve.

| **Component** | **Importance** | **Feasibility** |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| About Section | 5 | 5 |
| Tours Information | 4 | 4 |
| Booking Options | 4 | 3 |
| Contact Form | 5 | 4 |
| Transparent Pricing | 3 | 5 |
| Group Booking Information | 3 | 4 |
| Reviews Access | 4 | 2 |
| Image Gallery | 3 | 3 |
| Social Media Integration | 3 | 5 |
| Supplementary Media | 1 | 2 |

The graph below illustrates the relationship between importance and feasibility for each component. Components plotted closer to the top-right corner are both high in importance and feasible, making them top priorities for the project. Components in other quadrants help identify where compromises or adjustments may be needed.

<img src="assets/images/importance-viability-graph.webp" alt="Graph to show the importance/viability of different website components defined by Business Goals and User Stories" width="600">

Graph Insights:
- **High Importance & High Feasibility**: Components such as the **About Section**, **Contact Form**, **Tours Information**, and **Transparent Pricing** appear in this quadrant, making them the highest priority for the website. These are the backbone of the user experience and directly align with Clancy Nook’s primary goals of establishing credibility, simplifying bookings, and providing clear information.
  
- **High Importance & Moderate Feasibility**: Features like **Booking Options**, **Group Booking Information**, and **Reviews Access** are essential but require careful implementation. For example, while **Reviews Access** is crucial for building trust and encouraging bookings, the additional design and structural requirements make it slightly more complex to integrate. Nonetheless, it is still a key feature to include, especially as it directly supports the site's credibility and aligns with user needs for confidence in the service.
  
- **Moderate Importance & High Feasibility**: **Social Media Integration** stands out as a low-effort, high-reward feature. Adding social media icons in the footer enhances user engagement and encourages sharing without significantly increasing development complexity.

- **Low Importance & Low Feasibility**: Features like **Supplementary Media**, including brochures and audio snippets, rank lower in priority. While they could enhance the user experience, they are considered optional for the project's minimal viable product (MVP).

#### **Project Planning**
This analysis directly informs project planning by providing a clear roadmap for prioritizing features during development. Using the _GitHub Projects Board_ [here](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/3/views/2), I can allocate tasks based on importance and feasibility, ensuring high-priority components are delivered first. This approach aligns with the concept of a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**.

The **Scope Plane** in UX design also comes into play here, ensuring that the identified components fit within the project's constraints while still delivering a meaningful experience. By focusing on features in the high-importance/high-feasibility quadrant and working down, the project remains achievable without sacrificing value.
