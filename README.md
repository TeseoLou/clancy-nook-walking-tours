---

# **2. User Experience** 
User experience (UX) design focuses on creating meaningful, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and a product or service. For a website, this means designing a platform that meets users’ needs while providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

Prioritising user experience is essential to ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the site, achieve their goals, and enjoy the process. This is particularly relevant to the Clancy Nook website, where the goal was to cater to a diverse audience of locals, tourists, and corporate clients.

## **2.1. Strategy** 
The **Strategy Plane** in UX design formed the foundation of the project by aligning business goals with user needs. It addressed fundamental questions about what the website aimed to achieve and how it delivered value to its users.

For Clancy Nook, this meant not only creating an online presence but also ensuring the site served as a gateway for users to learn about, book, and engage with the historic walking tours offered. The strategy plane was the first port of call in the development process, as it established the overall purpose of the site and guided all subsequent design and development decisions.

### **2.1.1. Initial Discussion**

The development process for the Clancy Nook website began with an in-depth meeting with the client, Louis Cane. During this discussion, we explored key aspects of the business, including:

- The primary goals for the business and the website.
- Insights into Clancy Nook’s past operations, including its use of Linktree, TripAdvisor, and Eventbrite.
- Previous clientele and anticipated future clientele.
- Future goals to expand the business by attracting more corporate clients and building partnerships with community organizations. 

### **2.1.2. Business Goals**

The following business goals were established for the Clancy Nook website during the initial discussion phase. These goals emerged from a collaborative dialogue with the client, focusing on both immediate needs and aspirations for the future. While some goals centered on creating a strong digital presence and improving user experience, others reflected long-term ambitions, such as attracting corporate clients and collaborating with local communities.

Each business goal was paired with a corresponding call-to-action (CTA) designed to:

- Guide users toward desired actions such as booking a tour, learning more about the guide, or contacting for corporate inquiries.
- Make the website's purpose immediately clear to visitors.

1. Establish Online Presence  
   Created a professional and user-friendly website to build credibility for Clancy Nook as a premier provider of historic walking tours in Manchester.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Discover Clancy Nook and explore Manchester's rich history with our guided walking tours. Visit my website to learn more and join our community of history enthusiasts."_

2. Simplify Booking  
   Integrated seamless links to Eventbrite for easy tour booking while showcasing a personalized contact option for inquiries.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Book your spot on a Clancy Nook walking tour today through our Eventbrite integration or contact me directly for inquiries."_

3. Showcase Unique Value  
   Highlighted Louis Cane's deep knowledge of Manchester's history and the engaging storytelling that set Clancy Nook apart from other tours.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Experience Manchester’s history like never before with Clancy Nook, your expert guide and storyteller."_

4. Provide a Central Hub for Tour Information  
   Served as a central resource for tour details, showcasing engaging images, insightful descriptions, and glowing testimonials to entice potential customers.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Find all the details you need in one place—tour schedules, meeting points, and reviews—all at your fingertips."_

5. Encourage Repeat Customers  
   Built customer loyalty by offering exclusive updates on new tours or events through an optional newsletter signup.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Stay in the loop! Follow us on social media for updates on new tours and exclusive events."_

6. Attract Corporate Clients (Future Goal)  
   Expanded Clancy Nook's reach to the corporate world by showcasing tailored private tours for businesses, including team-building events, company outings, and cultural excursions.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Looking for a unique team-building experience? Contact me to arrange private walking tours."_

7. Facilitate Opportunities to Work with Communities (Future Goal)  
   Fostered connections with local communities by offering concession rates or free tours for underserved groups, contributing to the city’s cultural inclusivity.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Partner with Clancy Nook to make history accessible to all. Reach out for details about our community-focused tour initiatives."_

Goals 6 and 7, while not central to the website's initial development, represented aspirational objectives for the business’s growth and social impact. By planting the seeds for these initiatives early on, the site could evolve over time to accommodate these long-term ambitions.

### **2.1.3. User Demographics ** 

Understanding who attended and booked Clancy Nook tours helped establish clear user demographics. This process allowed for the identification of key user groups, their needs, and their motivations. These insights informed the development of tailored user stories and features for the website. By analyzing the clientele and tour attendance patterns, we aligned the website's functionality and content with the expectations of the target audience. This ensured that every feature and piece of information on the site resonated with its users and provided maximum value.

The demographics were broken down by tour type to account for the unique audience profiles each tour attracted:

- **City Center Tour:**  
  - 60-70% Mancunians: Local history enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of the city.  
  - 20-30% Tourists or Visitors: Out-of-town guests looking to explore Manchester's cultural and historical highlights.  
  - Diverse audience mix, including families, students, and older adults.

- **Whalley Range Tour:**  
  - Majority local residents: Individuals with a vested interest in the area's history or personal connections.  
  - New residents: Those wanting to learn about the neighborhood they now call home.  
  - Former residents: Occasional attendees revisiting for nostalgic reasons.

- **Ancoats Tour:**  
  - 80-90% from the wider Manchester region: Predominantly history enthusiasts who appreciated the industrial heritage of Ancoats.  
  - Currently lacking local attendance: Attracting Ancoats locals remained a growth area and a goal for the tour guide.

### **2.1.4. Target Audiences**  

The insights gathered from the demographic analysis and business goals allowed us to define the following target audiences for the Clancy Nook website. Each audience group aligned with specific business goals, helping to establish clear connections between user needs and the website's features.

1. New Users - Prospective Customers  
   First-time visitors exploring Clancy Nook and seeking information about tours to decide on booking.

2. Returning Users  
   Loyal customers looking for updates, new tours, and opportunities to engage further.

3. Locals  
   Residents of Manchester or surrounding areas interested in deepening their connection to the city’s history.

4. Tourists  
   Visitors to Manchester who wanted to learn about its cultural and historical highlights in an engaging way.

5. Corporate Users (Businesses) - Prospective Customers  
   Businesses interested in private tours for team-building events, company outings, or corporate retreats.

6. Community Leaders (Non-profits/Schools) - Prospective Customers  
   Organizations looking to collaborate with Clancy Nook for concession-priced or free educational tours tailored to their needs.

### **2.1.5. User Stories**  

For this project, user stories were developed to capture the diverse needs of Clancy Nook’s target audience, ensuring the website provided a user-centric experience. The creation of user stories helped define what different user groups—such as locals, tourists, corporate clients, and returning users—expected from the website. These stories bridged the gap between user needs and the technical development process, ensuring every feature contributed to a positive user experience and served as a roadmap for development and design decisions.  

To ensure effective and timely delivery, the user stories were divided into three priority categories: must-have, should-have, and could-have. These categories reflected the essential, important, and desirable features for the website.

- **Must-Have** stories represented the core functionalities that the website could not succeed without. These included fundamental aspects like clear navigation, booking instructions, a contact form, and reviews.  
- **Should-Have** stories included features that enhanced the user experience and catered to specific user groups, such as social media links and private tour information.  
- **Could-Have** stories consisted of advanced or supplementary features that, while not essential, would add extra value if implemented, such as downloadable brochures or storytelling audio clips.  

This prioritization ensured critical features were developed first while leaving room for additional improvements based on time and resources.

Must-Have

By creating and prioritizing these user stories, the website ensured a structured, user-focused development process that delivered meaningful value to both users and the business.

### **2.1.6. Emerging Website Components**

The analysis of user needs and expectations highlighted several critical components that formed the foundation of the Clancy Nook website. These components were designed to address the goals of both the business and its diverse user base, ensuring a user-friendly, informative, and engaging experience. Below are the core website components that emerged during the planning phase:

1. About Section  
   Including information about the guide’s historical knowledge and storytelling abilities emphasized the unique value Clancy Nook offered, particularly appealing to locals and history enthusiasts.

2. Tours Information  
   Providing clear and accessible details about available tours, including themes, schedules, meeting points, and additional details, was identified as a top priority. This ensured users could quickly learn about the experiences offered.

3. Booking Options  
   A streamlined booking process via integrated links to Eventbrite, combined with a user-friendly contact form for bespoke inquiries, made securing a spot on a tour simple and efficient.

4. Contact Form  
   A dedicated contact section provided users with an easy way to reach out for questions, inquiries about bespoke tours, or to request additional information, ensuring communication.

5. Transparent Pricing  
   Highlighting pricing information, including the pay-what-you-can option, ensured users understood the cost of the tours. This transparency encouraged bookings while showcasing Clancy Nook's accessibility for a wider audience.

6. Group Booking Section  
   Dedicated sections for corporate users and community leaders provided tailored information about private and group tours. This included details on how these tours could be customized to meet specific needs, reinforcing the business’s appeal to a broader audience.

7. Reviews Access  
   Featuring testimonials and reviews from past attendees helped build credibility and trust, particularly for new users and locals seeking assurance of tour quality.

8. Image Gallery  
   A gallery showcasing images from past tours provided a visual representation of the experiences offered. This component was designed to engage tourists and returning users, giving them a sense of the atmosphere and storytelling that Clancy Nook tours provided.

9. Social Media Integration  
   Social media links in the footer encouraged users to stay connected with Clancy Nook, providing updates and opportunities to share their experiences. This fostered community engagement and increased the visibility of the tours.

10. Supplementary Media  
    Supplementary resources, such as downloadable PDFs or brochures for corporate and private tours, provided businesses with shareable materials to aid in internal planning. Additionally, audio or video snippets of the guide’s storytelling offered a unique preview of the experience for prospective customers, enticing them to book a tour.

### **2.1.7. Importance/Feasibility**

The Importance/Feasibility analysis evaluated each website component based on two criteria: importance and feasibility. Importance referred to how critical the component was to achieving the business goals and addressing user needs outlined in the user stories. Feasibility, on the other hand, assessed the practicality of implementing the component within the project's constraints (e.g., timeline, resources, and technical expertise).

This analysis ensured that the development process prioritized components that delivered the most value while remaining achievable. By striking this balance, the project remained focused and efficient, delivering the maximum possible impact within its constraints.

The table below rated each component on a scale of 1 to 5 for both importance and feasibility:

- **Importance:** A rating of 1 meant the component had low relevance to business goals or user stories, while a 5 signified that the component was essential.
- **Feasibility:** A rating of 1 indicated that the component was difficult to implement within the project's constraints, while a 5 meant it was straightforward to achieve.

| **Component**             | **Importance** | **Feasibility** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| About Section             | 5              | 5               |
| Tours Information         | 4              | 4               |
| Booking Options           | 4              | 3               |
| Contact Form              | 5              | 4               |
| Transparent Pricing       | 3              | 5               |
| Group Booking Information | 3              | 4               |
| Reviews Access            | 4              | 2               |
| Image Gallery             | 3              | 3               |
| Social Media Integration  | 3              | 5               |
| Supplementary Media       | 1              | 2               |

The graph below illustrates the relationship between importance and feasibility for each component. Components plotted closer to the top-right corner are both high in importance and feasible, making them top priorities for the project. Components in other quadrants help identify where compromises or adjustments may be needed.

![Graph to show the importance/viability of different website components defined by Business Goals and User Stories](docs/figures/importance-viability-graph.webp)

Graph Insights:
- **High Importance & High Feasibility**: Components such as the **About Section**, **Contact Form**, **Tours Information**, and **Transparent Pricing** appear in this quadrant, making them the highest priority for the website. These are the backbone of the user experience and directly align with Clancy Nook’s primary goals of establishing credibility, simplifying bookings, and providing clear information.
  
- **High Importance & Moderate Feasibility**: Features like **Booking Options**, **Group Booking Information**, and **Reviews Access** are essential but require careful implementation. For example, while **Reviews Access** is crucial for building trust and encouraging bookings, the additional design and structural requirements make it slightly more complex to integrate. Nonetheless, it is still a key feature to include, especially as it directly supports the site's credibility and aligns with user needs for confidence in the service.
  
- **Moderate Importance & High Feasibility**: **Social Media Integration** stands out as a low-effort, high-reward feature. Adding social media icons in the footer enhances user engagement and encourages sharing without significantly increasing development complexity.

- **Low Importance & Low Feasibility**: Features like **Supplementary Media**, including brochures and audio snippets, rank lower in priority. While they could enhance the user experience, they are considered optional for the project's minimal viable product (MVP).

## **2.2. Scope**

The Scope Plane in UX design addressed the functional and content requirements necessary to fulfill the strategic objectives outlined in the Strategy Plane. While the Strategy Plane defined _why_ the project existed and _who_ it served, the Scope Plane determined _what_ the website needed to achieve those goals.

For the Clancy Nook website, the Scope Plane was essential to identifying the core features of the website by establishing what functional and content requirements enabled the project to meet its business goals and user needs effectively. The components, user stories, and business goals presented previously played a crucial role in defining and prioritizing these requirements, ensuring the project remained focused and aligned with its objectives.

### **2.2.1. Deriving Requirements**

Through this analysis, it became evident that the components summarized the essential requirements for the website in terms of what had to be achieved to deliver value to both users and the business. These requirements naturally prioritized themselves into three categories: must-have, should-have, and could-have requirements.

**Must-Have**
- Give users an overall feel for the brand/aesthetic

### **2.2.2. Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements defined the features and behaviors a website needed to meet user and business goals. In UX design and development, they ensured the website functioned as intended, allowing users to navigate, submit forms, and access information easily. During development, these requirements acted as a blueprint, helping prioritize tasks and allocate resources, ensuring the site fulfilled its purpose, from booking tours to sharing reviews effectively.

To determine which project requirements had functional requisites, the user stories, business goals, and UX components were reviewed. Functional requirements were categorized based on their scope and application:

- **Macro Functions:** Applied universally across the entire website (e.g., responsive navigation, accessibility).

  - Playable media (e.g., media snippets of the guide or tour previews)

### **2.2.3. Content Requirements**

Content requirements defined the textual, visual, and aesthetic elements a website needed to meet user needs and fulfill its purpose. They translated the website's strategy and scope into tangible components that aligned with business goals and user stories.

For Clancy Nook, content requirements provided the _what_ and _how_, filling the website's framework and ensuring users could access relevant materials like tour information, imagery, and branding elements. These requirements directly enhanced the site's usability and overall user experience (UX).

Content was the information users interacted with on a website. It drove engagement, built trust, and communicated value. For Clancy Nook, clearly defined content requirements ensured users could easily read and understand essential information, such as tour schedules and pricing, while also creating a visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic to align with the brand's identity.

To ensure a comprehensive and organized development process, the content requirements were divided into the following categories:
- **Graphic Content:** Visual assets that enhanced user engagement and showcased Clancy Nook's unique identity.
- **Textual Content:** Essential information guiding users through the website.
- **Aesthetic Content:** Defined the visual presentation of the website and reinforced the brand.
- **Interactive Content:** Dynamic content elements that facilitated user interaction.

**Must-Have**

## **2.3. Structure**

The **Structure Plane** in User Experience (UX) design focused on how the information within the project was organized and how users interacted with that information. It bridged the gap between the abstract elements of strategy and scope and the more concrete aspects of the user interface, defining how users experienced navigation and interaction with the website.

The Structure Plane encompassed navigation, which required a clear and consistent navigation scheme that reflected the importance and relationships of different core features. Additionally, interaction design played a key role in defining how users engaged with the website’s interface. This involved deciding on interaction models, selecting appropriate UI elements such as buttons, forms, and sliders, and designing feedback mechanisms that informed users of the system's responses to their actions. Furthermore, developing an effective information architecture was crucial. This included organizing website content in a logical manner for the target audience and often involved techniques like card sorting to involve users in the organization process.

For Clancy Nook, this section set the framework for structuring content and functionality in an intuitive and user-friendly way. Key considerations included mapping out the user flow to cover the user stories and ensuring that the navigation structure supported these journeys. Maintaining consistent patterns in layout and design was also vital in promoting instinctual navigation throughout the site while adhering to best practices. Additionally, the structure was designed to accommodate differently-abled users by ensuring semantic elements were appropriately used and ARIA labels were descriptive to support screen reader compatibility.

### 2.3.1 **_MoSCoW_ Prioritization**

Throughout the project, effective prioritization according to business goals, user needs, and developer capabilities was crucial. With the project scoped to develop a fully functional front-end site within a specific timeframe, continuously reevaluating priorities and core components ensured timely deployment while balancing essential and additional features.

Prioritization was key for managing the project under tight deadlines. To achieve this, the **MoSCoW prioritization technique** was used to categorize tasks. Initially, tasks were divided into **Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have** categories to allocate resources effectively and meet critical milestones. However, as the project progressed, the final component in this model was introduced: the **Won't-Have** category.

Introducing **Won't-Have** items marked a strategic decision to recognize and set aside features that were not feasible within the current constraints of timeframe, project requirements, skillset, or client resources. This categorization was not about permanently discarding features but rather temporarily deferring those that, while valuable, were not viable for the initial launch.

Unlike **Could-Have** items, which remained on the roadmap for potential inclusion if time and resources allowed, **Won't-Have** elements were explicitly not planned for this project phase. By clearly defining what would not be included in the initial deployment, a foundation was set for future enhancements as skills advanced and additional client resources were secured.

Several features were relocated to the **Won't-Have** category due to limitations in skillset, resources, and project scope. Below is a breakdown of these features:

- **Community/Concession Rates**  
  - The client was still finalizing details for community and concession rates, preventing their immediate inclusion.

- **Form Submission Functionality**  
  - Implementing real back-end form submission capabilities exceeded the current skill level, limiting forms to front-end functionality only.

- **Ability to Book on the Website**  
  - Direct booking required back-end skills and integration with reservation and payment systems, which were beyond the scope of this project.

- **Supplementary Media like Downloadable Brochures**  
  - The absence of client-created content for downloadable brochures delayed the implementation of this feature.

By defining **Won’t-Have** items early in the development process, the project maintained focus on delivering a high-quality, fully functional front-end website while ensuring room for future growth and improvements.

- 🔵 **Won’t-Have (Blue)** → Not feasible for this phase due to scope/time constraints  

### **2.3.2. Site Hierarchy**

Site hierarchy referred to the organization and structure of a website’s content and navigation. It determined how information was grouped, categorized, and accessed by users, impacting how efficiently they could find what they needed. A well-structured site hierarchy enhanced usability, accessibility, and overall user experience (UX) by guiding users through the website in a logical, intuitive way.

From a UX perspective, site hierarchy played a crucial role in:
- Ensuring easy navigation so users could find key information quickly.
- Minimizing frustration by preventing unnecessary clicks or confusion.

When designing a navbar and site structure, **standard best practices** guided how content was prioritized. These principles ensured a good user journey:

1. **The homepage**  
   - Always served as the first navigation item.  
   - Acted as the starting point for users to explore the site.

2. **Pages arranged in a logical order**  
   - Main content appeared first (e.g., Tours).  
   - Supplementary content followed (e.g., Gallery, Reviews).  
   - Action-oriented items (e.g., Contact) appeared last or were highlighted.

3. **About sections were commonly integrated into the homepage rather than a standalone page.**  
   - Many sites placed the About section on the homepage, ensuring quick access while keeping navigation concise.

4. **Primary actions were made visually distinct.**  
   - The most important action (e.g., "Contact") stood out using color or styling.

5. **Supporting functional pages:**  
   - A **404 Error Page** ensured that users were properly redirected if they encountered a broken link.  
   - A **Success Page** provided confirmation after users completed a form submission, reinforcing positive engagement.

By following these principles, the Clancy Nook website provided an intuitive user experience that aligned with expectations. The project identified which features should be standalone pages and which should exist as sections within pages.

| **Page Name**   | **Purpose** |
|------------|---------|
| **Home**   | Provides an overview of Clancy Nook, highlights key tours, and includes an embedded About section. |
| **Tours**  | Lists all available walking tours, including details on themes, schedules, and booking options. |
| **Gallery** | Showcases images from past tours to visually engage users. |
| **Reviews** | Features testimonials and feedback to build credibility. |
| **Contact** | Provides a contact form, direct contact details, and social media links. |
| **Success Page** | Confirms form submissions, ensuring users know their request was received. |
| **404 Error Page** | Provides an accessible, helpful page when users land on a broken or missing link, guiding them back to relevant content. |

The pyramid diagram visually represents the hierarchical structure of the Clancy Nook website, showing the relationships between the pages based on importance, functionality, user frequency and journey.

![Pyramid diagram representing the Clancy Nook website's hierarchy.](docs/figures/site-hierarchy-pyramid.webp)

To clearly define the purpose and function of each page, labels (_Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, Help, Witness, Worth, Welldone, and Whoops_) were assigned to understand how each page served user needs and supported Clancy Nook’s business goals.

1. **Homepage - _Welcome, What & Why_**  
   - Acted as the entry point, introducing Clancy Nook and the services provided.  
   - As the most visited page, it served as the primary starting point for users.  
   - The About section was placed within the homepage, aligning with standard practices.  
   - Provided a brief preview of available tours designed to engage and attract potential participants.

2. **Contact Page - _How & Help_**  
   - Many users navigated to this page after exploring the site, making it a key component of the hierarchy.  
   - Served a crucial role in the business by facilitating user inquiries.  
   - Highlighting "Contact" encouraged users to first explore the site and then take action.  
   - It was visually distinct in the navbar to emphasize its importance.

3. **About Section - _Who_**  
   - Provided essential background on Clancy Nook.  
   - While not a standalone page, it was a key section in the customer journey.

4. **Tours as the Central Page - _Which, Where & When_**  
   - Represented the core offering of the business.  
   - Served as the center page of the customer journey, following the homepage and preceding the contact page.

5. **Gallery & Reviews as Supporting Pages - _Witness & Worth_**  
   - Helped build trust and provided additional engagement but were secondary to the tours themselves.  
   - Offered a visual representation of past tours, helping potential customers get a feel for the experience.  
   - Showcased testimonials from previous customers, reinforcing credibility and trust.

6. **Success Page & 404 Page as Supporting Functional Pages - _Welldone & Whoops_**  
   - The Success Page provided a confirmation message after users submitted a form, preventing confusion.  
   - The 404 Error Page ensured users were given helpful redirection options rather than encountering a dead end.

The finalized navbar order followed both best practices and business goals:

![Diagram of the Clancy Nook website navbar](docs/figures/site-hierarchy-navbar.webp)

This structure ensured a logical and effective user journey, guiding visitors through exploring tours, seeing testimonials, and finally contacting the guide.

The **Success Page** and **404 Page** existed as functional pages but were not included in the navigation. Instead:
- The Success Page was triggered after form submissions.
- The 404 Error Page automatically loaded if users entered an incorrect or broken URL.

### **2.3.3. Navigation**

Effective navigation was fundamental to user experience (UX) design, ensuring users could explore the website intuitively while being guided toward key actions. Standard navigation best practices emphasized clarity, consistency, and accessibility, making it easy for users to find what they needed while supporting the business’s objectives.

For the Clancy Nook website, navigation was structured to balance free access via the navbar with a logical journey between related pages, aligning with standard web design conventions, user needs, and business goals. Good website navigation followed three key principles:

1. **Predictability** – Users should know where to go next without confusion.  
2. **Efficiency** – Important pages should be accessible within one or two clicks.  
3. **Guidance** – While users could explore freely, the site should encourage a natural progression.

Navigation directly supported Clancy Nook’s business objectives by:
- **Promoting tour bookings** – The tours page served as a focal point of the site, with multiple entry points leading users there.  
- **Building trust** – The reviews and gallery pages reinforced credibility, leading users towards booking.  
- **Encouraging engagement** – The site provided prominent contact options to make inquiries easy.

By structuring the navigation around user intent and business priorities, the site helped new visitors discover Clancy Nook, validate its credibility, and complete a booking inquiry effortlessly.

As a standard web convention, the navbar appears across all pages, giving users immediate access to:

**📌 Home 📌 About 📌 Tours 📌 Gallery 📌 Reviews 📌 Contact**  

This reflected a widely recognized pattern in website navigation, where the website was structured to encourage a natural progression through interconnected pages.

1. **Homepage** served as the entry point.  
2. **About Section** followed, providing background context.  
3. Core service (**Tours Page**) took central focus.  
4. Supporting content (**Gallery & Reviews Pages**) enhanced credibility.  
5. **Contact Page** remained a prominent final step for conversions.

While the **Success Page** and **404 Error Page** were not part of the core navigation, they still played an essential role in the site's user experience. These pages existed within the Clancy Nook website, ensuring users remained within the site's ecosystem.

**🎉 Success ❌🔗 404 Error**  

6. **Success Page** provided confirmation after a form submission, reassuring users that their action was completed successfully. It prevented uncertainty and offered a clear next step, such as returning to the homepage or exploring more tours.  
7. **404 Error Page** provided helpful redirection options to guide users back to relevant sections of the site, such as the homepage or tours page. If users reached a broken or non-existent link, the 404 page ensured they were not met with frustration.

Certain actions required external platform navigation, integrated into the user journey:

**🔗➡️ Booking 🔗➡️ Review 🔗➡️ Social Media**

8. **Booking (Eventbrite)** – Linked from the Tours and Contact pages.  
9. **Review Platform (TripAdvisor)** – Linked from the Reviews page.  
10. **Social Media** – Found in the footer and relevant sections for engagement.

This ensured that while external tools handled bookings and reviews, users always felt anchored within the Clancy Nook website.

This diagram illustrates the navigation of the Clancy Nook website, showing how users can move between core pages such as Home, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact. It also depicts external navigation links to social media, booking, and review platforms, as well as functional pages like the 404 Error and Thank You pages, which guide users when they encounter errors or complete actions.

### **2.3.4. User Interaction (UI)**  

Interaction design played a crucial role in shaping how users engaged with the website’s interface. It involved determining effective interaction models, selecting suitable UI elements like buttons, forms, and sliders, and implementing feedback mechanisms that provided users with clear responses to their actions. The goal was to create an intuitive and engaging experience that aligned with user expectations and business objectives.

Effective interaction design followed industry best practices to ensure intuitive usability:

- Provided clear and predictable interactions, minimizing user frustration.  
- Implemented visual feedback mechanisms (such as hover effects, form validation, and confirmation messages).  
- Used sticky navigation or footers for quick access to essential functions.  
- Designed forms with dropdowns, auto-fill options, and validation messages to enhance usability.  
- Ensured smooth scrolling for intuitive page transitions, especially on mobile devices.  

The Clancy Nook project applied these best practices while considering previous design decisions to guide users through the site. Therefore:

1. Navbar elements were designed to be intuitive, ensuring users could easily explore tour options and make inquiries.  
2. The footer provided additional navigation buttons, improving accessibility without cluttering the main interface.  
3. The booking process was streamlined, with clear CTAs directing users to external platforms such as Eventbrite.  
4. Forms used conditional fields while providing real-time feedback for missing or incorrect inputs.  
5. Error handling mechanisms (such as the 404 page) prevented dead ends, guiding users back to relevant content.  
6. A success page confirmed user actions, ensuring clarity after a form submission.  

#### **2.3.4.a. Navbar**  

The navbar was a crucial aspect of user experience, ensuring that users could easily move between different sections of the website. A **sticky navigation bar** remained at the top of the screen as users scrolled, ensuring quick access to key pages without needing to scroll back up. This improved usability and accessibility.

#### **2.3.4.b. Navicons**  

A **fixed footer** remained at the bottom of the page, providing additional navigation buttons for quick access to key areas and social media pages.

#### **2.3.4.c. Buttons**  

Text-based buttons were used to guide users through the website.  

- **Contact** button was prominently placed to ensure easy access to making inquiries.  
- **Submit** button was included in the contact form, providing clear action confirmation.  
- **Home** button was available on the 404 Error and Success pages, allowing users to easily navigate back to the main site.  

Each button had a corresponding **call-to-action**, encouraging users to take the next step, whether it was making an inquiry or finalizing a booking.

**Logo buttons** for _Eventbrite_ and _TripAdvisor_ were placed on the Tours and Reviews pages, respectively. These buttons provided direct access to Eventbrite for booking tours and TripAdvisor for reading and submitting reviews, ensuring a easy transition to these external platforms.

#### **2.3.4.d. Clickable Tour Cards** 

Another interactive feature designed to enhance user engagement was the **clickable tour cards** on the homepage. These cards provided a brief summary of each featured tour, giving users an overview of the available experiences. To encourage interaction, users could click on a card, which would take them directly to the corresponding tour section on the **Tours** page.  

This feature included:  

- **Hover Effects**, where the card would expand slightly and a shadow would appear to create a sense of depth.  
- A **call-to-action** at the beginning of the section, informing users that they could click on any tour for more details.  

![Wireframe of four tour cards displaying tour names and descriptions](docs/figures/user-interaction-tour-cards.webp)

#### **2.3.4.e. Image Carousel**

To enhance the user experience on the **Tours** pages, image carousels were implemented, allowing users to easily browse through historic photos of landmarks featured on the tours. These interactive elements provided a dynamic visual preview of the experiences offered, helping potential customers make informed decisions.  

To balance convenience with interactivity, each carousel included:

#### **2.3.4.f. Form Fields**
The contact form provided a simple and accessible way for users to ask questions or make inquiries. To improve usability and streamline interactions, several design choices were implemented to enhance the user experience.

- **Required Fields** prevent form submission unless all necessary details are provided, improving data accuracy.
- **Error Handling** and **Validation** notify users of missing or incorrect entries, prompting them to make corrections before submitting.
- **Dropdown Select** allow users to select predefined options, reducing input errors and making the form easier to complete.
- **Conditional Fields** dynamically appear based on the selected message subject, ensuring users only see relevant input fields, reducing clutter and improving efficiency.
- **Radio Buttons** enable users to quickly select a specific tour, simplifying the booking or inquiry process.
- **Rating Slider** allows users to provide feedback on their experience, offering an intuitive way to rate tours.
- **Image Upload** functionality enables users to submit images (JPEG and PNG formats only), allowing them to share photos relevant to their inquiry or review.
- **Placeholders** guide users through the required fields, ensuring they understand what information is needed.

![Wireframe of a contact form with conditional fields in three different states.](docs/figures/user-interaction-form.webp)

### **2.3.5. Information Architecture (IA)**
The structuring, organization, and labeling of website content ensured that users could easily navigate and find relevant information. This critical aspect of user experience (UX) design influenced how content was grouped, connected, and accessed.

When designing a website's information architecture, several key principles were considered to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

1. **Hierarchy & Organization**: Content is structured logically, with core pages easily accessible through the navigation bar, and supplementary content grouped into relevant sections.
2. **Logicality & Flow**: The structure follows a natural user journey, ensuring that pages and sections connect in a way that makes sense. Users are guided from broad introductory content to specific details, reducing friction and cognitive load.
3. **Findability & Accessibility**: Users should be able to locate key information efficiently, with minimal clicks.
4. **Consistency**: Layout, terminology, and navigation patterns remain uniform across all pages to reduce confusion.
5. **Scalability & Flexibility**: The structure allows for future growth, ensuring new content can be integrated without disrupting usability.

This diagram visualizes information architecture for the site as well as the the hierarchy and relationships between pages, interactive elements, and external links. The structure follows established UX best practices while integrating the project's strategic goals.

## **2.4. Skeleton** 
The **Skeleton Plane** in UX design built upon the **Structure Plane**, refining the foundational layout into a tangible, user-friendly interface. While the Structure Plane established how the website’s content and navigation were organized, the Skeleton Plane focused on how users interacted with these elements, ensuring a A  and intuitive experience. This included defining how navigation, interactive features, and responsiveness contributed to a fluid user journey.

Navigation design was introduced in the Structure Plane to establish a clear hierarchy and logical content flow. In the **Skeleton Plane**, this concept was further refined into visual and interactive navigation elements that efficiently guided users through the site.

The Skeleton Plane introduces three aspects of user experience:

1. **Interface Design**: Determines the placement of buttons, forms, images, and interactive elements, ensuring they are intuitive and user-friendly.
2. **Information Design**: Focuses on how content is structured and displayed, ensuring readability, accessibility, and logical progression of information.
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensures that the layout, interactive components, and navigation adapt fluidly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, providing a consistent and accessible experience regardless of screen size.

### **2.4.1. Navigation Design**
A well-designed navigation system enhanced usability and supported business objectives by guiding visitors toward key actions. In the Skeleton Plane, navigation design was an extension of the structural foundation laid out in the previous phase. While the Structure Plane defined how content was organized and how different sections related to one another, the Skeleton Plane determined how users visually perceived that structure.

When designing a website’s navigation, industry best practices focused on clarity, consistency, and predictability. Standard conventions included:

- **Navigation Bars**: Ensuring the primary navigation was always accessible without users having to scroll back up.  
- **Logical Ordering of Menu Items**: Following a structure that mirrored user intent and expected progression.  
- **Clear Labels & Readability**: Avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms in navigation links.  

Effective navigation also considered the natural progression of a user journey when visiting a website, taking into account:  

- **Predictable Flow**: The navbar, footer navigation, and internal links maintained consistency across all pages, reinforcing intuitive movement.  
- **Progressive Discovery**: Content was structured to lead users naturally from exploration (**Homepage & Tours**) to engagement (**Reviews & Gallery**) and finally to action (**Contact & Booking**).  
- **Interaction & Feedback**: Hover effects, active states, and visual indicators provided clear cues when users engaged with navigation elements.  

The Clancy Nook website’s navigation followed a hierarchical order that aligned with user expectations:  

1. **Homepage** (_Overview_) – Visitors first needed an introduction to Clancy Nook and the experience it offered.  
2. **About** (_Who Provides the Service?_) – Established credibility by introducing the guide.  
3. **Tours** (_What is the Service?_) – Provided clear details on what was being offered.  
4. **Gallery** & **Reviews** (_How Good is the Service?_) – Allowed users to see testimonials and images from past tours to build trust.  
5. **Contact** (_Next Steps – Booking, Inquiry, or Review Submission_) – Provided a clear action point to either book a tour, submit a review, or ask a question.  

#### **2.4.1.a. Navbar**
The primary navigation bar (as shown in the wireframe) followed these principles by presenting the most relevant pages in a structured and easy-to-scan format. Key design choices included:

- **Sticky Positioning**: Ensured that users always had access to navigation, no matter where they were on the page.  
- **Clear Hierarchy**: The order of menu items reflected the natural progression of user interest.  
- **Hover Feedback**: When users hovered over navigation links, the text was underlined to reinforce interactivity and improve clarity.  
- **CTA Emphasis**: The "Contact" button was visually distinct, guiding users toward taking action.  

![Navigation bar design for the Clancy Nook website, displaying menu options](docs/figures/user-interaction-navbar.webp)

#### **2.4.1.b. Footer Navigation**
In addition to the primary navbar, the footer navigation served as a secondary means of guiding users through the site. To maintain simplicity and user familiarity, icons were carefully chosen based on widely recognized symbols that users instinctively associated with their functions.  

- **Additional Access to Core Pages**:  
  The footer contained links to important sections like the **Homepage, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact pages**, reinforcing the primary navigation structure.  

- **Social Media Links**:  
  Icons for **Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn** provided direct links to Clancy Nook’s presence on these platforms. These choices aligned with user expectations, ensuring instant recognition for social media engagement.  

- **Alternative Navigation in Case of Page Errors**:  
  If users landed on a **404 Error page**, the footer ensures they could return to the homepage without frustration.  

To enhance usability, the icons and navigation links in the footer featured **hover effects** that subtly changed color or added a shadow effect when hovered over. This feedback mechanism improved user interaction by reinforcing interactivity, making it clear which elements were clickable and guiding users effortlessly.  

![Website footer mockup featuring social media icons and a small navigation menu with icons.](docs/figures/user-interaction-footer.webp)

#### **2.4.1.c. Access Points & Interactive Elements** 
Navigation extended beyond menus—buttons served as additional access points, ensuring smooth user interactions. These elements were **strategically placed** across the site to align with user intent and facilitate consistent movement between pages and actions.  

- **Call-to-Action Buttons**  
   - **Contact Button**: Encourages users to get in touch for inquiries and bookings.  
   - **Submit Button**: Located within the contact form, ensuring clarity in form submission.  
   - **Home Button**: Appears on the **Success** and **404 Error** pages, helping users return to the main site effortlessly.  

![Three buttons labeled 'Contact,' 'Home,' and 'Submit,' designed for user interaction.](docs/figures/user-interaction-buttons.webp)

- **External Links/Logo** Buttons

## **2.5 Surface**

The Surface Plane was the final stage of UX design, where structure, interaction, and aesthetics came together to create a visually polished and intuitive interface, shaped by the underlying skeleton. While earlier phases focused on functionality, content organization, and interactivity, this stage refined color schemes, typography, spacing, contrast, and branding consistency to enhance usability and engagement.

For Clancy Nook, the visual identity was more than just an interface—it embodied the essence of the business. The design reflected rich storytelling heritage, deep historical connections, and ties to Manchester’s past. The aesthetic approach carefully balanced tradition with modern usability, fostering a sense of exploration, discovery, and historical intrigue while ensuring clarity and ease of use for all visitors.  

Each design element—from typography inspired by historical manuscripts to a warm, inviting color palette echoing Manchester’s industrial and cultural legacy—was thoughtfully selected to establish Clancy Nook as a knowledgeable and engaging tour experience.

The followingC visual design principles were considered:

- **Hierarchy & Focus** – Highlighting content as clear focal points, using contrast and typography to guide user attention.  
- **Consistency** – Standardizing color schemes, spacing, and typography for a cohesive and professional appearance across all pages.  
- **Accessibility** – Ensuring WCAG compliance, including high-contrast text, scalable font sizes, and readable typography.  
- **Clarity & Readability** – Using clear, legible fonts, adequate line spacing, and structured layouts to improve content consumption.  
- **Minimalism & Simplicity** – Removing unnecessary elements to highlight key interactions and maintain a clean, user-friendly experience.

### **2.5.1 Branding and Aesthetic**

Much of the Surface Plane was directly influenced by the initial meeting with Louis Cane, where the essence of Clancy Nook’s brand identity was explored. During this discussion, a thematic direction rooted in storytelling, history, mystery, and intrigue was established, forming the core of Clancy Nook’s persona. These discussions guided the design choices, ensuring that every visual aspect of the website aligned with Louis’s existing branding, including logos and imagery that evoked a sense of exploration and discovery.

These images played a crucial role in reinforcing this alignment, depicting Louis Cane as Clancy Nook in his tour guide attire, embodying the Victorian-era historian and storyteller that defined his brand. This persona was not just a marketing tool but an integral part of the tour experience itself—when visitors booked a tour, they stepped into a world of curated narratives and historical insights.  

![Clancy Nook Banner on Social Media](docs/images/clancy-nook-banner.webp)  

![Clancy Nook Profile Icon on Social Media](assets/images/clancy-nook-about.webp)

### **2.5.2. Color Palette**

Color was essential for branding, navigation, and user interaction. The website’s palette balanced historical authenticity with modern usability and accessibility. Inspired by Clancy Nook’s branding and Louis Cane’s tour guide persona, the aesthetic reflected Victorian-era storytelling, emphasizing mystery, heritage, and exploration.  

To ensure the selected colors met both branding and accessibility requirements, _Adobe Color_ was used to extract a historically resonant yet web-friendly palette. This tool enabled the derivation of primary and secondary hues from key brand imagery, ensuring visual coherence across all design elements.  

![Clancy Nook color palette](docs/figures/color-palette.webp)

The WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines required a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text to ensure accessibility. Additionally, WCAG 2.1 mandated a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for graphics and user interface components, such as form input borders, ensuring key functional elements were easily distinguishable. For an even higher level of accessibility, WCAG Level AAA required a 7:1 ratio for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text, benefiting users with more severe visual impairments.

To ensure the Clancy Nook website met these accessibility standards, I tested various color combinations using _Contrast Checker_. This analysis allowed me to determine which color pairings were suitable for different design elements.

1. **High-contrast combinations** (4.5:1 or higher) were reserved for body text and critical information to maximize readability.
2. **Moderate contrast ratios** (3:1 - 4.5:1) were used for larger text elements, such as headings and section titles.
3. **Lower contrast colors** that do not meet accessibility thresholds for text were applied to decorative or background elements, ensuring they do not interfere with readability.

![Clancy Nook color contrast validation](docs/figures/color-contrast-checker.webp)

The background color for the website was set to Cream (#F3EED8) to provide a warm, neutral base that ensured readability without overwhelming users. Dark Brown (#3C331C) was chosen for the primary text color, as it maintained a contrast ratio above 4.5:1 against the cream background, meeting accessibility standards for normal text. This pairing ensured that content remained legible across various devices and lighting conditions.

For key navigational elements and interactive components, Dark Blue (#2B4A4A) was selected as the navbar background with Cream (#F3EED8) text, ensuring an at least 7:1 contrast ratio, compliant with WCAG AAA standards.

Accent colors were incorporated to highlight interactive elements without sacrificing accessibility.

- **Caramel (#EDC479)** served as a warm highlight color, providing contrast in call-to-action elements and the footer background.
- **Light Blue (#7EA5A2)** added a cooler accent for visual balance, applied in secondary design elements such as cards and form backgrounds.

The final palette was tested using _Chroma Tool_ for deuteranopia (red-green deficiency), protanopia (red blindness), and tritanopia (blue-yellow deficiency). This ensured that all critical UI elements maintained clear visual contrast across different types of color blindness. This commitment to accessibility aligned with WCAG 2.1 best practices, reinforcing readability and usability for a diverse audience.

![Clancy Nook color contrast validation](docs/figures/color-colorblind-safe-checker.webp)

### **2.5.3. Typography**
When designing the Clancy Nook website, I aimed to replicate the original typography used in the Clancy Nook Facebook banner. However, as the exact font was unknown, I turned to _Google Fonts_ to find a close match. After thorough exploration, I selected IM Fell Double Pica, a historically inspired serif font that aligned with the brand’s heritage-driven aesthetic.

IM Fell Double Pica offered several advantages:

1. **Legibility**
   - Moderate x-height and well-proportioned letterforms improve clarity.
   - Sufficient spacing between characters enhances readability.
   - Clear differentiation between characters prevents misinterpretation.
2. **Readability**
   - Works well for long text passages, maintaining a comfortable reading flow.
   - Suitable for captions and digital displays, preserving clarity even in smaller sizes.
3. **Visual Fatigue & Adaptability**
   - While its traditional design can lead to visual fatigue in extensive reading, limiting its use to headings and navigational elements ensures a balanced user experience.
   - Adaptable across different devices and languages, maintaining legibility and aesthetic appeal.

![Clancy Nook secondary font for headers](docs/figures/im-fell-double-pica.webp)

This font is exclusively used for headings and navigation, and to optimize readability, it is applied in UPPERCASE. This decision was made to reinforce Clancy Nook’s historical aesthetic while ensuring that text remains legible and impactful, providing:

- Improved clarity  
- Enhanced visibility in navigation  
- Stronger branding presence  

To complement IM Fell Double Pica’s ornate, old-world feel, I used _FontForge_ to identify a modern, highly readable sans-serif for body text. Montserrat was chosen for its clarity, versatility, and strong visual contrast, ensuring readability without detracting from Clancy Nook’s period-inspired branding.

![Clancy Nook font-pairing](docs/figures/font-pairing.webp)

Montserrat offers several key benefits:

1. **Legibility**
   - A clean and crisp design ensures clear character differentiation, even at small sizes.
   - A generous x-height improves clarity, making it easier to distinguish similar letters.
   - Well-spaced letterforms contribute to optimal readability in diverse text settings.
3. **Readability**
   - Works well for long text passages, captions, and digital displays.
   - Ensures consistent clarity across devices, preventing strain in prolonged reading sessions.
   - Its modern aesthetic makes it highly effective for both digital and print media.
4. **Visual Fatigue & Adaptability**
   - Montserrat’s design minimizes visual fatigue, making it suitable for extensive reading.
   - Adaptable across various devices, screen resolutions, and languages, ensuring a universal reading experience.
   - Its multiple font weights allow for hierarchical structuring of content, guiding users through the site.

### **2.5.4. Imagery**
Visual storytelling played a crucial role in shaping the Clancy Nook website, immersing users in rich historical narratives while enhancing engagement. Carefully curated imagery, subtle overlays, shadows, and dynamic elements worked together to create an authentic and visually compelling experience.

#### **2.5.4.a. Hero Banners**
Hero images served as focal points across the website, immediately setting the tone for visitors. These visually striking elements were positioned near the top of pages, often spanning the full width. They provided visitors with an immediate introduction to the brand while shaping their first impression and overall user experience.

An effective hero image should:

- Capture attention instantly  
- Visually communicate the brand’s value proposition  
- Guide users toward relevant content or actions  

The homepage hero image, featuring a historical Manchester street in Ancoats, was designed with complementary colors to draw users into the site. A semi-transparent overlay was applied to these images, ensuring text readability while preserving the atmospheric depth and vintage aesthetic.

The hero image for the Tours page captured the intrigue of Clancy Nook’s storytelling. A moody Manchester street scene in the city center was selected, featuring the same overlay to maintain visual consistency and enhance the immersive experience.

#### **2.5.4.b. Backgrounds**
Throughout the site, full-width background images complemented key pages, such as the reviews and contact page. They provided a strong sensory connection to the service being offered without overwhelming the content. Light blue was selected as the background for the sectional elements containing content, such as the review cards and contact form, ensuring accessibility for all users.

Key considerations for background imagery:  
- High-resolution & optimal sizing (< 2048px x 1536px)  
- Brand alignment & authenticity  
- Readability & accessibility  
- CSS implementation & responsiveness  
- Static backgrounds for immersion  
- Performance optimization  

The reviews page featured a historic building with ornate windows and an external fire escape, reinforcing Clancy Nook’s connection to Manchester’s industrial and architectural heritage. The design ensured that user testimonials remained the focal point while maintaining visual harmony, using a light blue overlay on the review cards.

The contact page background featured the Thirsty Scholar pub, a well-known Manchester landmark, directly linking to the city's vibrant history and Clancy Nook’s tour locations. The consistent light blue overlay was applied with slight transparency, while opaque, muted cream input fields provided subtle contrast. This design choice created a vintage yet accessible feel, ensuring both usability and aesthetic cohesion.

#### **2.5.4.c. Black & White Imagery**
The Clancy Nook website incorporated historical imagery from the Manchester Local Image Collection, a public domain archive documenting the city's evolution. These black-and-white photographs of Victorian streets, industrial districts, and historic landmarks established a strong sense of place and authenticity, immersing users in the setting before they even stepped onto a tour.

Black and White Images in Web Design:  
- Lessened distractions  
- Offered a minimal aesthetic  
- Provided a sophisticated look  
- Focused on light, form, and texture  
- Did not detract from the color palette  

This approach aligned with Clancy Nook’s historical branding, which was drawn heavily from Victorian-era newspaper reports from the 1800s and early 1900s. This choice evoked the feel of archival materials and historical publications, reinforcing the tours’ connection to the past.

Additionally, group photos taken by tourists were been edited into black and white to maintain visual consistency across the website. These images, originally shared by visitors, were used with full consent for business purposes, ensuring that prospective customers see real tour experiences while preserving the historical aesthetic.

#### **2.5.4.d. Carousels**
To enhance user engagement and create an interactive experience, the tours page featured image carousels, allowing visitors to scroll through a curated selection of historical and contemporary images. These carousels visually previewed key locations, historical sites, and moments from past tours, striking a balance between historical authenticity and modern storytelling.

NN/g UX Experts suggest carousels should:  
- Include 5 or fewer frames  
- Ensure that navigation controls appear inside the frame  
- Use crisp-looking images  

The carousel format was chosen to keep the page structured and visually engaging while avoiding excessive imagery that might overwhelm the Tours page layout. This ensured a smooth user experience, allowing visitors to explore different aspects of each tour at their own pace.

#### **2.5.4.e. Gallery**
The gallery page was intentionally the most colorful and visually rich section of the website, contrasting with the muted, vintage tones used elsewhere. While other sections focused on historical authenticity with black-and-white images, the gallery embraced full-color photography, emphasizing the vibrancy and energy of the tours.

A well-designed website gallery should have:  
- High-quality, authentic images  
- Cohesive layout  
- Immersive experience  
- Diverse perspectives  

The gallery prioritized high-resolution photos to maintain clarity and professionalism. The borderless, collage-style arrangement ensured that images flowed naturally, immersing visitors in the tour experience. This approach minimized visual clutter and enhanced the feeling of continuity between moments.  

A mix of candid group photos, architectural shots, and historical landmarks created a balanced visual representation, allowing potential customers to envision themselves on the tour, engaging with the locations and narratives.  

Most images in the gallery were taken by Louis Cane or were shared by tourists with explicit consent for business use. To maintain transparency and ethical integrity:  

- Some images were sourced from free-use libraries, ensuring copyright compliance.  
- Third-party photos were used with permission, properly crediting contributors where needed.  
- Some photos were color-edited using _Photokit_ to match the site’s palette aesthetic.  

### **2.5.5. Buttons**
The button design across the Clancy Nook website prioritized usability, accessibility, and aesthetic consistency to maximize user experience.

To ensure clarity and usability, button design followed web accessibility and UI/UX best practices:

- **Consistent Sizing & Placement**
- **High Contrast for Readability**
- **Large Clickable Areas**
- **Clear Visual Feedback**

#### **2.5.5.a. Call-to-Actin Buttons**
These buttons maintained uniform spacing and dimensions across pages, improving clickability on both desktop and mobile. Text was always easily legible, avoiding low-contrast combinations. Buttons had ample padding, making them easy to tap on mobile devices.

- **Light Buttons**: A cream background with dark serif typography, maintaining readability and an elegant vintage feel.  
- **Dark Buttons**: A deep green background with contrasting cream text, offering an alternative for varied visual appeal.

Both button types changed to a warm caramel tone upon hover or interaction. This aligned with the call-to-action overlays and footer, reinforcing branding consistency.

#### **2.5.5.b. Navbar & Logo**
- **Navbar Tabs**: Styled without borders, these buttons used a simple underlined effect on hover to maintain a clean, vintage aesthetic.  
- **Logo Home Button**: Designed in _Canva_ based on Louis Cane's specifications, this logo replicated a wax seal style with Clancy Nook’s initials encircled by cotton flowers, symbolizing Manchester’s industrial heritage. On hover, the logo turned light blue, offering subtle interaction feedback.

### **2.5.5.c. Iconography**
Icons played a vital role in enhancing navigation, accessibility, and user engagement across the Clancy Nook website. The use of _Font Awesome_ ensured a consistent and visually appealing icon set that aligned with the site's historical theme while maintaining modern usability.

To maintain usability and consistency, best practice includes:

- **Simplicity & Recognition**
- **Consistent Styling**
- **Hover & Click Effects**
- **Mobile-Friendly Scaling**

The following design choices are: 
- **Minimalist & Monochrome Icons** styled in a dark tone that complements the site's muted color palette, ensuring clarity without overwhelming the design.
- **Social Media & Contact Icons** easily recognizable symbols for email, phone, and social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) make contacting Clancy Nook intuitive.
- **Tour Information Icons** small but sensible icons for distance, duration, and cost improve readability, quickly conveying essential details without excessive text.
- **Footer Navicons** secondary navigation bar utilises simple, intuitive icons for home, profile, tours, gallery, favorites, and reviews, offering a streamlined browsing experience.

# **6. Bugs and Fixes**
During the development process, several bugs and unexpected issues arose, requiring investigation and troubleshooting. Below is a breakdown of the main bugs encountered, their causes, and how they were resolved (or why they couldn’t be fully fixed).

## **6.1. Navbar Overlap**
During the development of my website, I wanted the navbar to remain fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling to improve navigation. To achieve this, I used the Bootstrap class fixed-top in my nav element:

However, this introduced an issue:
- The start of the body content was cut off, hidden beneath the navbar.
- This happened because the navbar was removed from the normal document flow, causing the rest of the page to ignore its height.
- This issue was most noticeable on anchor links, as they scrolled to a position that placed sections behind the navbar.

Cause of the Issue
- The fixed-top class fixes the navbar to the top of the viewport, meaning it no longer occupies space in the document layout.
- The page content started at the very top, effectively underneath the navbar.

I made the following adjustments:
1. Move body element down. 
   - To ensure the body content was fully visible and not hidden by the navbar, I added padding-top: 86px; to the body element, where 86px is the height of the navbar.

This simple fix pushed the content down, ensuring it started below the navbar.

## **6.2 Anchor Link Overlap**
After setting my navbar to be fixed (fixed-top), I noticed a problem when clicking anchor links (e.g., "About" in the navbar). Instead of scrolling neatly to the section, the page would scroll too far up, hiding the start of the section behind the navbar.

Cause of the Issue:
- Since the navbar was fixed, it no longer occupied space in the document layout.
- Clicking an anchor link scrolled the section to the top of the viewport, placing it behind the navbar.
- The first few lines of content were obscured, making navigation confusing.

To prevent this, I implemented a hidden anchor div that acted as an offset:
1. Created an empty div element with id="about-anchor" before the About section:
   - This invisible div serves as a new anchor point for the link.
2. Updated the navigation link to scroll to #about-anchor instead of #about:
3. Styled the #about-anchor div to create an offset equal to the navbar height:

This simple but effective trick significantly improved usability and ensured a polished scrolling experience across my website. This solution was inspired by web design tutor @dereksiuau, whose method of using an offset anchor div provided an elegant and effective approach.

## **6.3. Mini Navbar**
During the development of the website, I implemented a mini navigation bar in the footer to provide quick access to key pages. Initially, this component was structured using a div, but after further evaluation, I recognized that a more semantically accurate approach would be to use the nav element, aligning with accessibility and best practices.

Upon switching the div to a nav, I noticed that the styling I had previously applied was no longer functioning correctly. 

The primary issues included:
- Unexpected layout changes: The icons became misaligned and displayed in an unintended order.
- Loss of background color and box shadow: The originally styled navigation box lost its intended background color and box shadow.
- Spacing inconsistencies: The previously well-spaced icons were now too close together.
- Responsiveness issues: The mini navbar did not maintain its intended compact form, particularly on larger screens.

I made the following adjustments:
1. Updated the CSS Selectors:
   - Since nav has different default styling behavior compared to div, I explicitly targeted #footer-navigation and .footer-nav-box to ensure the new structure was styled consistently.
2. Restored the Grid Layout for Icons
   - By using display: flex and flex-wrap: nowrap on .footer-nav-box, I was able to keep the icons in a single row by default, ensuring they didn’t stack unintentionally.
3. Enhanced Responsiveness with Media Queries
   - On small screens, the mini navbar remained in a horizontal row.
   - On larger screens, a grid-based layout was implemented (grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);), making the navbar more compact and readable.
   - Fixed the Background Transparency
   - The .footer-nav-box had lost its intended transparency due to inheritance differences in nav. Adding background-color: transparent !important; ensured the footer’s design remained visually appealing.
4. Adjusted the Icon Spacing and Hover Effects
   - Using gap: 12px; and restoring the transform: scale(1.2) hover effect, I ensured that the icons had sufficient spacing and smooth interactions.
5. Ensured Accessibility Compliance
   - The aria-label attributes for each link were checked to confirm that they provided descriptive, screen-reader-friendly navigation.

After implementing these fixes, the mini navbar in the footer correctly displayed in its intended format across all devices, maintained accessibility standards, and functioned smoothly while keeping its original styling.

## **6.4. Anchored Icon Positioning** 
While working on the footer section, I noticed that the social media icons (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) were not aligning properly with the phone and email icons on the left side. This created a visual inconsistency, making the layout feel unbalanced.

The key issues were:
- The social media icons were slightly higher than the phone and email icons.
- The phone and email icons aligned perfectly with the text, while the social media icons did not.
- The difference was more noticeable on smaller screens, where the misalignment became more pronounced.

After inspecting the CSS and HTML, I found that:
1. Font Awesome icons have different default sizes and alignment properties, depending on whether they are solid (fa-solid) or brand (fa-brands).
2. The phone and email icons used fa-lg or fa-xl, which slightly adjusted their vertical alignment with text.
3. The social media icons were inside anchor elements, which introduced inline styles that modified their positioning.
4. The default height and margin-bottom values were not the same across the icons, causing them to shift out of alignment.

I made the following adjustments:
1. Standardized Icon Sizes
   - I made sure all icons used consistent Font Awesome classes to match their size. 
2. Applied Explicit CSS Rules
   - I added the following styles to ensure uniform height (24px), bottom margin (8px) and lafter padding (0):
3. Aligned Icons Using Flexbox
   - To further refine alignment, I updated the social media row to use flexbox: display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;
4. Checked for Responsive Behavior
   - I tested the fix on various screen sizes to make sure the alignment remained consistent across different breakpoints.

The phone, email, and social media icons now align perfectly, the footer section looks visually balanced across all screen sizes and the icons scale correctly, and there is no noticeable misalignment anymore.

## **6.5 Hero Banner Responsiveness**
When designing the hero banner for my homepage, I wanted it to be fully responsive while maintaining a consistent visual appearance across different screen sizes. I took inspiration from the Love Running Project, which demonstrated how to structure a hero section effectively.

Initially, when adjusting the page for different screen sizes, I noticed that:
- On smaller screens, the entire image would shrink, reducing its impact.
- On larger screens, the image stretched, sometimes losing focus on key visual elements.
- The hero section wasn't behaving consistently, making the layout appear unpolished.

Key Causes of the Problem:
1. Default Scaling Behavior – Without specific styling, the hero image scaled proportionally with the width of the screen. This meant:
   - On smaller screens, the entire image shrank down, reducing its visibility and impact.
   - On larger screens, the image stretched wider than intended, sometimes shifting the focus away from key elements.
2. Lack of a Fixed Height – Since images typically resize based on their container, the height of the hero image was changing dynamically, which caused inconsistent results across different devices.
3. Background Image Properties – By default, if background-size is not explicitly set, the browser may either:
   - Scale the image down to fit smaller screens.
   - Expand the image width on larger screens, causing unwanted distortion or loss of key visual details.

To resolve this, I applied CSS background properties to ensure the hero image maintained its size while adjusting dynamically to different screen widths:
1. background-size: cover; ensures the image fills the section without stretching.
2. background-position: center; keeps the most important part of the image visible.
4. height: 400px; guarantees a consistent height across all devices.
5. position: relative; sets the element's positioning relative to its normal position in the document flow.

## **6.6. Call-to-Action Alignment**
After implementing the responsive hero image, I encountered a new issue The title  and subtitle within the call-to-action (#call-to-action) were not centrally aligned.

The key issues were:
- The text was shifting inconsistently across different screen sizes.
- On smaller screens, it appeared too high or too low.
- The overlay wasn't staying centered, affecting readability.
- The call-to-action wasn’t positioned correctly over the hero image, making it look disjointed.

Key Causes of the Issue
1. Default Document Flow and Positioning Conflicts
   - The #call-to-action overlay was inside the #homepage-hero section but was not positioned explicitly.
   - Since block-level elements (like h1 and h2) follow normal document flow, they were shifting based on content and screen size changes, making alignment inconsistent.
2. Lack of Defined Positioning
   - The #call-to-action overlay initially relied on automatic alignment, which caused:
      - On smaller screens, the text appeared too high or too low.
      - On larger screens, the overlay wasn’t centered, affecting readability.
3. Parent Element’s Default Behavior
   - The #homepage-hero section was positioned relatively, but the call-to-action overlay needed explicit absolute positioning to stay aligned inside the hero banner.

To ensure the call-to-action overlay remained consistently positioned, I applied absolute positioning within the #homepage-hero section:
1. position: absolute; ensured that the #call-to-action overlay was anchored inside the #homepage-hero section instead of moving with the page content.
2. top: 25%; placed the text in the upper third of the hero section, making it visually balanced.
3. z-index: 100; ensured the text overlay stayed visible on top of the hero image.

## **6.7 Responsive About Section**
One of the biggest challenges I faced while designing the About section was ensuring that it had a responsive layout that looked good across all screen sizes:

- On smaller screens (mobile and tablets): The layout needed to be vertically stacked, with the image appearing above the text for a natural reading flow.
- On larger screens (laptops and desktops): The layout needed to be horizontally aligned, with the image on one side and the text + signature on the other side to create a visually balanced structure.

At first, my attempts did not scale properly across devices:
- The text and image alignment was inconsistent.
- The image would sometimes overlap the text.
- The signature positioning felt awkward in some cases.

To resolve these issues, I structured the section using Bootstrap’s grid system for flexible, responsive positioning:
1. Wrapped everything inside a .row so that Bootstrap automatically handled column layouts:
   - This ensures responsiveness without needing complex media queries.
2. Defined column behavior for different screen sizes:
   - col-12 for mobile: Image and text are stacked vertically.
   - col-lg-4 for larger screens: Image takes up 4 out of 12 columns, placing it to the side.
   - col-lg-8 for larger screens: Text takes up 8 out of 12 columns, ensuring alignment next to the image.
4. Used Bootstrap’s text alignment classes (text-center, text-lg-start, text-end) to control text alignment dynamically:
   - On mobile screens, the text remains centered.
   - On larger screens, the text aligns left (text-lg-start) to match the horizontal layout.
5. Positioned the signature (#signature) correctly using Bootstrap’s flex utilities:
   - On mobile screens, the signature appears below the text.
   - On larger screens, the signature is aligned to the right, complementing the horizontal layout.

By making the most of Bootstrap’s grid system and text utilities, I was able to achieve a fully flexible and visually appealing About section without requiring excessive custom CSS.

## **6.8. Tour Card Heights**
When creating the Tours Overview section, I noticed an inconsistency where the tour cards were displaying at different heights. This created a misaligned and unpolished appearance, particularly on tablet and desktop screens.

This was a problem I had encountered before in the Boardwalk Games walkthrough project, so I knew what was causing the issue and how to fix it.

The root cause of the issue was:
- The card height was being determined by the text content inside .card-body.
- Cards with shorter descriptions had a smaller height, while those with longer descriptions expanded.
- This caused the tour cards to misalign in a row, creating an uneven and visually unbalanced layout.

To ensure all the tour cards maintained a consistent height, I applied a minimum height (min-height) to the .card-body section at different screen breakpoints:
1. Applied min-height to .card-body to keep all cards uniform.
2. Adjusted min-height at different screen sizes to maintain responsiveness.

This meant all cards were the same height, creating a clean, professional layout. It prevented cards from collapsing when content was shorter than others and maintained responsiveness by adjusting min-height at different breakpoints.

## **6.9 Tour Section Title** 
When designing the featured tour sections, I wanted the title of each tour to adjust dynamically based on the screen size:
- On mobile screens, the title should appear above the carousel for a stacked layout.
- On small laptops (medium screens), the title should be positioned above the carousel but in a wider format.
- On large desktops, the title should be beside the carousel and above the description, creating a more balanced and visually appealing layout.

However, the titles were not behaving as expected across breakpoints, caused by:
- Bootstrap’s default grid behavior, which stacked elements unpredictably across breakpoints.
- Lack of explicit positioning for the title at different screen sizes.
- Misalignment of flex properties, which caused inconsistencies in spacing and placement.

To ensure the title adjusted correctly for all screen sizes, I:
1. Used Bootstrap utility classes (d-flex, d-none, d-lg-flex) to dynamically display the title in different positions.
2. Placed one h2 element above the carousel for mobile screens and another inside the text container for larger screens.
3. Applied custom CSS margin and alignment adjustments at different breakpoints.

The titles now adjust for a polished, readable layout. On mobile, they stack above the carousel; on medium screens, they stay above with proper spacing. On large desktops, they align beside the carousel and above the text, ensuring a cohesive design across all devices.

## **6.10. Responsive Card Groups**
When designing the tour details card group using the Bootstrap Card Group template, I encountered issues with alignment and responsiveness across different screen sizes. The details (price, duration, distance, and location) were not aligning evenly and were shifting inconsistently depending on the screen size. Sometimes, they would appear misaligned or too spaced out, making the layout feel unpolished.

The misalignment stemmed from Bootstrap's automatic column wrapping behavior combined with differences in text length. Specifically:
- Unequal text lengths in the tour details (e.g., "Free" vs. "Thirsty Scholar, M1 5NP") caused height variations, making some cards appear taller than others.
- Bootstrap’s default flex behavior was causing elements to shift into an uneven grid structure, especially on medium-sized screens.
- Lack of a defined structure in how elements distributed within the .row class resulted in cards collapsing or stretching unevenly.
- The absence of a fixed height for the .tour-details elements meant that smaller cards would shrink while longer text elements would expand, throwing off the overall alignment.

I applied Bootstrap flex utilities and column sizing. The final solution involved:
1. Applying Bootstrap’s row and col classes to maintain a two-column layout on smaller screens and a four-column layout on larger screens.
2. Utilizing justify-content-md-center and justify-content-lg-start to ensure cards aligned properly at different breakpoints.
3. Adding a .tour-details class with a fixed width to keep uniform spacing between elements.
4. Using align-content-xl-between to ensure that on extra-large screens, the content distributed evenly without overlapping or excessive spacing.
5. Fine-tuning spacing via media queries, adjusting margins and paddings for large desktops to prevent inconsistencies.

The tour details cards now maintain even spacing across all screen sizes. On mobile screens, they stack neatly into two columns, while on medium screens, they stay balanced and centered. On large desktops, the cards align in a structured four-column layout, creating a polished and visually cohesive presentation.

## **6.11. Gallery Layout** 
When coding the gallery section, I initially used a masonry-style layout, similar to the approach in the Love Running project. This provided responsiveness but resulted in an unstructured look at the bottom of the page. The varying heights of different columns caused an uneven, jagged appearance, making the layout feel messy rather than polished.

To address this, I first ensured that all landscape images shared the same aspect ratio and all portrait images maintained a uniform size. However, this only partially improved the issue—while it helped with visual consistency, the gallery still didn't align neatly across different breakpoints.

Failed Attempts to Fix the Issue:
- Using grid-auto-flow: dense; in CSS: I attempted to control image arrangement, but it still led to uneven column heights.
- Setting fixed heights for images: This resulted in some images being awkwardly cropped, which disrupted the natural aspect ratio.
- Forcing equal-height columns: This caused distortion in some images, reducing the overall aesthetic quality of the gallery.

To achieve a clean and structured gallery layout, I implemented separate gallery designs at different breakpoints:
1. The key to this structured layout was using div elements strategically to control the flow and organization of images, particularly in the tablet and laptop versions of the gallery.
2. Tablet View
   - Instead of a simple stacked list of images, I used div containers to create structured row groupings.
   - Within each row, images were either placed side by side (landscape images) or arranged in a stacked column (portrait images).
3. Laptop/Desktop View 
   - Here, div containers defined specific columns within the grid, ensuring the layout remained balanced.
   - Some div elements spanned multiple rows to fill space naturally, while others contained stacked portrait images to maintain a structured feel.
   - Using d-flex and align-items-stretch, I ensured the images adapted dynamically without breaking the layout.

By utilizing div-based grouping, I eliminated jagged edges at the bottom of the gallery, prevented uneven columns, and maintained a crisp, well-structured grid system across different screen sizes.

## **6.12. Background Scrolling**
I encountered an issue where the background images on both the Reviews and Contact pages scrolled along with the content, rather than remaining static. This disrupted the intended aesthetic, making the pages feel less polished and reducing the immersive effect.

Cause of issue: 
- By default, the background property in CSS applies an image relative to the element’s content.
- As users scrolled down, the background moved along with the content.
- The .container and other sections had their own height properties.
- This caused the background to shift instead of staying fixed in place.

To fix this, I:
1. Fixed Background Issue:
   - The key fix was applying background-attachment: fixed;, ensuring the background remained static while content scrolled over it.
2. Structural Adjustments:
   - Used position: relative; to maintain content alignment.
   - Set height: 100%; and width: 100vw; to ensure full coverage.
3. Responsive Design for Different Screens:
   - Implemented media queries to swap background images for medium and large screens.
   - Prevented image distortion by selecting appropriately sized background images.
   - Ensured clarity and visual consistency across all device sizes.

The solution was found on MDN Web Docs, which recommended using background-attachment: fixed; to keep the background in place. Implementing this ensured the background remained fixed on both the Reviews and Contact pages, creating a more polished effect.

## **6.13. Form Field Responsiveness**
Even after implementing Bootstrap’s grid system to keep input fields aligned on larger screens, I encountered an issue where some fields were unexpectedly pushed onto a new line. This disrupted the intended layout, making the form appear uneven and less structured.

Cause of the Issue
- The default Bootstrap column spacing (gutter) added unintended margins.
- When a row’s total column width slightly exceeded 100%, it forced elements onto a new line.
- This was especially problematic on mid-sized breakpoints where field widths fluctuated.

As a solution I: 
1. Refined Column Sizing
   - Adjusted column sizes proportionally to ensure they fit within a single row.
   - Used col-md-4, col-lg-3, and col-xl-3 to better distribute space without exceeding row limits.
2. Made Margin & Padding Adjustments
   - Manually reduced margins on input fields to prevent them from exceeding the row width.
   - Applied margin: 0; to affected fields to override Bootstrap’s default spacing.
   - Used row w-100 on the form’s container to ensure a consistent structure across breakpoints.

The input fields now align correctly on all screen sizes, preventing unexpected breaks. Bootstrap’s responsive classes function smoothly without margin conflicts.

## **6.14. Styling Form Inputs** 
While using Bootstrap’s default input styling, I noticed inconsistencies in how the fields appeared across different browsers. Borders, background colors, and padding were not uniform, leading to a lack of visual consistency in the form design. Additionally, some inputs appeared slightly misaligned, disrupting the overall structure.

Cause of the Issue:
- Bootstrap’s built-in form styling varies slightly across browsers.
- Default styles didn’t match the aesthetic of the rest of the form.
- Inconsistent padding and borders made input fields look uneven.

To ensure all input fields had a uniform and professional appearance, I created a custom .box class with the following styles:
1. Consistent dimensions: Set width: 100%; height: 40px; to ensure uniform sizing.
2. Matching background color: Applied background-color: var(--primary-color--); for integration with the page design.
3. Uniform borders: Used border: 1px solid var(--tertiary-color--); for a subtle but clear separation.
4. Subtle depth effect: Added box-shadow: inset 0 0 1px 1px #af9f80; to create a slight inset effect, improving contrast and visibility.

Input fields now appear consistent across all browsers, maintaining a polished and accessible design. Credit: The box-shadow technique was inspired by a Stack Overflow post by Zoltan Toth.

## **6.15. Conditional Dropdowns** 
When designing the contact form, I wanted specific fields—such as Tour Selection and Review Options — to appear only when relevant, based on user input. However, implementing this functionality from scratch was beyond my current development capabilities, so I looked to CodePen for assistance.

Cause of the Issue:
- By default, all form fields were displayed at once, making the form cluttered and overwhelming.
- There was no logic to dynamically show or hide sections based on user choices.
- I needed a way to keep the form clean and intuitive, ensuring users only saw relevant inputs.

I found a CodePen demo by, which demonstrated how to toggle form fields:
1. Implemented JavaScript with the toggleFields() function to show or hide fields based on selection.
   - When users selected "Booking a Tour", the tour selection radio buttons appeared.
   - When users selected "Leave a Review", the rating slider and file upload became visible.
2. Enhancing the User Experience:
   - Used .classList.add("hidden") and .classList.remove("hidden") for smooth field transitions.
   - Ensured hidden fields didn’t disrupt the form layout when inactive.

The form is now cleaner and more intuitive, showing only relevant fields based on user input. The logic for conditionally displaying form sections was inspired by Dustin Horstmann’s CodePen demo on dynamic form fields.

## **6.16. Rating Slider** 
To enhance user experience, the rating slider needed a star icon that moved dynamically as users selected a rating. I used Fajar Nur Wahid’s CodePen project on interactive sliders to help me style the slider. However, the star initially failed to align properly with the selected value, making the interaction feel imprecise.

Cause of the Issue:
- The star’s position was not dynamically updating in sync with the slider value.
- The percentage offset applied wasn’t correctly scaled to the slider’s length.
- CSS positioning and margins were not optimized for accurate alignment.

To resolve this, I: 
1. Implemented JavaScript to track slider movement and dynamically adjust the star’s position:
   - The 93 value in the calculation represented the percentage range for mapping slider movement but needed fine-tuning to prevent the star from moving too far to the right.
   - The +0.5rem adjustment was necessary to keep the star visually centered, preventing it from appearing too far left at lower values or too far right at maximum values.
   - Tweaked CSS margins and left positioning to further refine alignment.

The star now moves smoothly in sync with the slider, staying correctly centered over each rating. Inspired by Fajar Nur Wahid’s CodePen project on interactive sliders and Josh Collinsworth's Emoji Slider.

## **6.17. Hidden Form Labels** 
While testing the contact form with the WAVE accessibility tool, it flagged that my labels—set to be hidden for visual purposes—weren’t correctly connected to their corresponding input fields. This could make the form less accessible for screen readers and assistive technologies.

Cause of the Issue:
- I had labels for each input field but used display: none;, which removed them entirely from the document flow.
- This meant screen readers couldn’t associate the labels with their respective inputs.
- Without properly connected labels, users relying on assistive technology would struggle to understand form fields.

I found a Bootstrap solution that maintains accessibility while keeping labels visually hidden:
- Used the visually-hidden-focusable class instead of display: none;.
- This ensures labels remain in the document for screen readers but don’t disrupt the visual design.
- When users navigate via keyboard, the labels become visible, improving usability.

The contact form is now accessible while maintaining a clean design. Hidden labels are readable by screen readers, resolving WAVE’s flagged issue. Solution inspired by Bootstrap’s visually-hidden-focusable class.

## **6.17. Outcome** 
All identified bugs and issues encountered during development were successfully resolved. Through thorough manual and automated testing, the website now functions as intended across all screen sizes, browsers, and accessibility tools. No known unresolved bugs remain, ensuring a polished, fully functional, and user-friendly experience.

# **8. Future Developments**
While the current version of the Clancy Nook website is fully functional and optimized, there are several enhancements planned for future iterations. These improvements will address performance concerns, enhance accessibility, introduce new interactive features, and improve overall functionality.

## **8.1. Addressing Lighthouse Performance Insights**
During performance testing with Google Lighthouse, several key areas were identified for potential improvement:

Eliminating Render-Blocking Resources  
- Lighthouse flagged Bootstrap CSS and Google Fonts as render-blocking resources, which slightly delay page rendering. 
- While I have looked into using _cdnjs.com_ to help mitigate this issue, addressing render-blocking resources effectively is beyond the scope of this project. 

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization  
- Since this project is intended to be a fully professional site, I do not want to compromise on image quality or change any of the images. 
- In the future, when I am working with a graphic designer, I would like them to optimize and resize the images within the flow while maintaining their intended visual impact. 

Reducing Unused CSS  
- As Bootstrap and FontAwesome include many unused styles, I have looked into the following solutions but have been unable to fully address this during this project window:  
  - Using _purgeCSS_ to remove unused styles in production.  
  - Exploring a custom Bootstrap build to include only the necessary components.  

## **8.2. Enhanced Contact Form Functionality**
Currently, the contact form is static, meaning user submissions do not send messages to the website owner. A key goal for future development is to make this form fully functional.  
In the short term, a simple Email Service API would be an effective solution:  
- Using an external API service such as Formspree.
- Allows form data to be emailed directly to the site owner.
- Does not require backend hosting, making it easy to implement.  

However, in the long term, I want to develop a custom backend solution as I advance my skills in future modules:   
- Implementing a server-side application.
- Handling form submissions securely and efficiently.

## **8.3. Video Content Integration**
Once video content becomes available, I plan to integrate it into the website to enhance engagement and provide a richer user experience. Potential uses include:
- Embedding short promotional videos on the homepage to give visitors a preview of the tours.
- Including tour highlight videos on the relevant tour pages to give users a visual introduction.
- Providing behind-the-scenes footage or interviews with the tour guide for added storytelling.

## **8.4. Downloadable Tour PDFs**
For improved accessibility, I plan to offer downloadable PDFs of the tour details. These will serve multiple purposes:
- Allowing users to access tour information offline.
- Providing an accessible text-based alternative for those with visual impairments or reading difficulties.
- Serving as a printable guide for visitors who prefer physical copies.
 
## **8.5. Forking the Repository and Custom Domain Name**
Currently, the project is hosted on GitHub Pages using the default .github.io subdomain. To make the website more professional and easier to share, I plan to:
- Fork the repository to create a new version with refined features.
- Purchase a custom domain name (e.g., clancynooktours.com).
- Link the custom domain to GitHub Pages using DNS settings.

# 12. Honourable Mentions 
**Louis Cane**:  
   The mastermind behind Clancy Nook! Watching you go all-in on your passion and turn it into something real was a huge inspiration for me to do the same with this project. It’s been an absolute honour creating this site for (and with) you—your enthusiasm made it what it is. Having the opportunity to build something real, on a subject that’s been genuinely fascinating, and for someone I care about, has made this an incredibly rewarding experience.  

**Isaac Derbyshire**:  
   Not only did you keep me caffeinated and fed, but your insistence on a healthy workspace, hydration, and (begrudgingly) occasional fresh air probably saved me from having a hunched back and square eyes. Without you, this project might have derailed into sleep-deprived chaos. And when disaster struck at the worst possible moment—my charger breaking just before submission—you literally ran to get a replacement, saving the day in true hero fashion. More than that, you’re my partner in all things, embracing every part of me—my focus, my chaos, my excitement, my deep dives into whatever I’m obsessing over. I couldn’t have done this without you.  

**David Bowers**:  
   Being matched with a fellow *AuDHD-er* as my mentor was pure luck. You’ve mastered the balance of pushing me while knowing when to tell me to slow down. Your insights—both from completing this course and understanding my neurodivergence—have been invaluable. Your top-tier advice on accessible tools, productivity hacks, and working with my brain rather than against it has been fantastic.  

**Georgie Thomas**:  
   The voice of reason who fought to make me take breaks (even when I resisted with all my might). Your commitment to hard work and dedication to your own passions has been incredibly encouraging. You have a way of reminding me of the things I need to hear when doubt creeps in or when things get heavy. Your patience, care, and refusal to let me burn myself out mean more than I can put into words, and I’m endlessly grateful for you. I always look forward to time spent with you. I hope you embrace these words as a reminder of your strength. You work so hard, and you deserve to have fun, look after yourself, and be confident in what you do.  

**Gilly Hsu**:  
   The person who gave me the push I needed to start this course, embarking on a similar journey yourself. You’ve always believed in me, and seem to think far too highly of me. Your  confidence in my abilities has been a source of motivation, and I can’t overstate how much that has meant. You are the cleverest person I know, and I feel incredibly lucky to have your support and unique friendship.  

**Nel Lane** and **Gabe Ison**:  
   The dynamic duo who made sure I didn’t turn into a hermit. Balance achieved! Dragging me away from my screen, making sure I actually existed outside of work has been invaluable, even if I have discovered I am *terrible* at Skittles in the process. The occasional late rise and slow start to my workday because of time spent laughing, adventuring, or just unwinding with you was more than worth it. A special shoutout to **Nel** for all the amazing times spent cooking together—turning mealtime into a joyful experience where I could be calm. And to **Gabe**, for embracing silliness, keeping things exciting, and making me laugh.
