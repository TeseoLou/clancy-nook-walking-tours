## Introduction

## User Experience (UX)
User experience (UX) design focuses on creating meaningful, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and a product or service. For a website, this means designing a platform that meets users’ needs while providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

Prioritising user experience is essential to ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the site, achieve their goals, and enjoy the process. This philosophy is particularly relevant to the Clancy Nook website, where the goal is to cater to a diverse audience of locals, tourists, and corporate clients.

### Strategy
The Strategy plane in UX design forms the foundation of any project by aligning business goals with user needs. It addresses fundamental questions about what the website aims to achieve and how it delivers value to its users. 

For Clancy Nook, this meant not only creating an online presence but also ensuring the site serves as a seamless gateway for users to learn about, book, and engage with the historic walking tours offered. The strategy plane was the first port of call in the development process, as it established the overall purpose of the site and guided all subsequent design and development decisions.

By starting with the strategy, the project focused on identifying key objectives—such as enhancing visibility, streamlining booking processes, and showcasing the unique value of the tours—and balancing these with the needs of diverse user groups like tourists, locals, and corporate clients. This foundational step ensured that every feature and design element served a clear purpose, meeting both user expectations and business ambitions.

#### Initial Discussion
The development process for the Clancy Nook website began with an in-depth meeting with the client, Louis Cane. During this discussion, we explored key aspects of the business, including:
- The primary goals for the business and the website.
- Insights into Clancy Nook’s current operations, including its use of Linktree, TripAdvisor,  and Eventbrite.
- Current clientele and future clientele.
- Future Goals to expand the business by attracting more corporate clients and building partnerships with community organizations. 

#### Business Goals
The following business goals were established for the Clancy Nook website during the initial discussion phase. These goals emerged from a collaborative dialogue with the client, focusing on both immediate needs and aspirations for the future. While some goals centered on creating a strong digital presence and improving user experience, others reflected long-term ambitions, such as attracting corporate clients and collaborating with local communities.

Each business goal is paired with a corresponding call-to-action (CTA) designed to:
- Guide users toward desired actions such as booking a tour, learning more about the guide, or contacting for corporate inquiries.
- Make the website's purpose immediately clear to visitors.
