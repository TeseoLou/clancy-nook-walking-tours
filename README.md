3. Build a professional online presence for Clancy Nook.

---

## **User Experience (UX)**
User experience (UX) design focuses on creating meaningful, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and a product or service. For a website, this means designing a platform that meets users’ needs while providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

Prioritising user experience is essential to ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the site, achieve their goals, and enjoy the process. This philosophy is particularly relevant to the Clancy Nook website, where the goal is to cater to a diverse audience of locals, tourists, and corporate clients.

---

### **Strategy**
The **Strategy Plane** in UX design forms the foundation of any project by aligning business goals with user needs. It addresses fundamental questions about what the website aims to achieve and how it delivers value to its users. 

For Clancy Nook, this meant not only creating an online presence but also ensuring the site serves as a seamless gateway for users to learn about, book, and engage with the historic walking tours offered. The strategy plane was the first port of call in the development process, as it established the overall purpose of the site and guided all subsequent design and development decisions.

By starting with the strategy, the project focused on identifying key objectives—such as enhancing visibility, streamlining booking processes, and showcasing the unique value of the tours—and balancing these with the needs of diverse user groups like tourists, locals, and corporate clients. This foundational step ensured that every feature and design element served a clear purpose, meeting both user expectations and business ambitions.

---

#### **Initial Discussion**
The development process for the Clancy Nook website began with an in-depth meeting with the client, Louis Cane. During this discussion, we explored key aspects of the business, including:
- The primary goals for the business and the website.
- Insights into Clancy Nook’s current operations, including its use of Linktree, TripAdvisor,  and Eventbrite.
- Current clientele and future clientele.
- Future Goals to expand the business by attracting more corporate clients and building partnerships with community organisations. 

---

#### **Business Goals**
The following business goals were established for the Clancy Nook website during the initial discussion phase. These goals emerged from a collaborative dialogue with the client, focusing on both immediate needs and aspirations for the future. While some goals centered on creating a strong digital presence and improving user experience, others reflected long-term ambitions, such as attracting corporate clients and collaborating with local communities.

Each business goal is paired with a corresponding call-to-action (CTA) designed to:
- Guide users toward desired actions such as booking a tour, learning more about the guide, or contacting for corporate inquiries.

#### **User Demographics**
Understanding attends and books Clancy Nook tours establishes clear user demographics, which permitted the identification of key user groups, their needs, and their motivations. These in turn informed the development of tailored user stories and features for the website. By analysing the clientele and tour attendance patterns, we could align the website's functionality and content with the expectations of the target audience. This ensured that every feature and piece of information on the site would resonate with its users and provide maximum value.

The demographics were broken down by tour type to account for the unique audience profiles each tour attracts:
- **City Center Tour:**
  - **60-70% Mancunians:** Local history enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of the city.
  - **20-30% Tourists or Visitors:** Out-of-town guests looking to explore Manchester's cultural and historical highlights.
  - **Diverse Audience Mix:** Includes families, students, and older adults.

- **Whalley Range Tour:**
  - **Majority Local Residents:** Individuals with a vested interest in the area's history or personal connections.
  - **New Residents:** Those wanting to learn about the neighborhood they now call home.
  - **Former Residents:** Occasional attendees revisiting for nostalgic reasons.

- **Ancoats Tour:**
  - **80-90% from the Wider Manchester Region:** Predominantly history enthusiasts who appreciate the industrial heritage of Ancoats.
  - **Currently Lacking Local Attendance:** Attracting Ancoats locals remains a growth area and a goal for the tour guide.

---

#### **User Stories** 
For this project, user stories developed capture the diverse needs of Clancy Nook’s target audience, ensuring the website provides a user-centric experience. The creation of user stories helped define what different user groups—such as locals, tourists, corporate clients, and returning users—expect from the website. These stories bridge the gap between user needs and the technical development process, ensuring every feature contributes to a positive user experience and serve as a roadmap for development and guiding design decisions. 
 
To ensure effective and timely delivery, the user stories were divided into three priority categories: **must-have**, **should-have**, and **could-have**. These categories reflect the essential, important, and desirable features for the website.

- **Must-Have** stories represent the core functionalities that the website cannot succeed without. These include fundamental aspects like clear navigation, booking instructions, contact form and reviews.  
- **Should-Have** stories include features that enhance the user experience and cater to specific user groups, such as social media links and private tour information.  
- **Could-Have** stories consist of advanced or supplementary features that, while not essential, would add extra value if implemented, such as downloadable brochures or storytelling audio clips.  

This prioritisation ensures that critical features are developed first while leaving room for additional improvements based on time and resources.

#### **Emerging Website Components**
The analysis of user needs and expectations highlighted several critical components that would form the foundation of the Clancy Nook website. These components were designed to address the goals of both the business and its diverse user base, ensuring a user-friendly, informative, and engaging experience. Below are the core website components that emerged during the planning phase:
1. **About Section**  
   Including information about the guide’s historical knowledge and storytelling abilities emphasises the unique value Clancy Nook offers, particularly appealing to locals and history enthusiasts.

2. **Tours Information**  
   Providing clear and accessible details about available tours, including themes, schedules, meeting points, and additional details, was identified as a top priority. This ensures users can quickly learn about the experiences offered.

3. **Booking Options**  
   A streamlined booking process via integrated links to Eventbrite, combined with a user-friendly contact form for bespoke inquiries, makes securing a spot on a tour simple and efficient.

4. **Contact Form**  
   A dedicated contact section provides users with an easy way to reach out for questions, inquiries about bespoke tours, or to request additional information, ensuring seamless communication.

5. **Transparent Pricing**  
   Highlighting pricing information, including the pay-what-you-can option, ensures users understand the cost of the tours. This transparency encourages bookings while showcasing Clancy Nook's accessibility for a wider audience.

6. **Group Booking Section**  
   Dedicated sections for corporate users and community leaders provide tailored information about private and group tours. This includes details on how these tours can be customised to meet specific needs, reinforcing the business’s appeal to a broader audience.

#### **Importance/Feasibility**
The Importance/Feasibility analysis evaluates each website component based on two criteria: importance and feasibility. Importance refers to how critical the component is to achieving the business goals and addressing user needs outlined in the user stories. Feasibility, on the other hand, assesses the practicality of implementing the component within the project's constraints (e.g., timeline, resources, and technical expertise).

This analysis ensures that the development process prioritises components that deliver the most value while remaining achievable. By striking this balance, the project remains focused and efficient, delivering the maximum possible impact within its constraints.

The table below rates each component on a scale of 1 to 5 for both importance and feasibility:
- **Importance:** A rating of **1** means the component has low relevance to business goals or user stories, while a **5** signifies that the component is essential.
- **Feasibility:** A rating of **1** indicates that the component is difficult to implement within the project's constraints, while a **5** means it is straightforward to achieve.

| **Component**             | **Importance** | **Feasibility** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| About Section             | 5              | 5               |
| Tours Information         | 4              | 4               |
| Booking Options           | 4              | 3               |
| Contact Form              | 5              | 4               |
| Transparent Pricing       | 3              | 5               |
| Group Booking Information | 3              | 4               |
| Reviews Access            | 4              | 2               |
| Image Gallery             | 3              | 3               |
| Social Media Integration  | 3              | 5               |
| Supplementary Media       | 1              | 2               |

The graph below illustrates the relationship between importance and feasibility for each component. Components plotted closer to the top-right corner are both high in importance and feasible, making them top priorities for the project. Components in other quadrants help identify where compromises or adjustments may be needed.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/importance-viability-graph.webp" alt="Graph to show the importance/viability of different website components defined by Business Goals and User Stories" width="700">
</div>

Graph Insights:
- **High Importance & High Feasibility**: Components such as the **About Section**, **Contact Form**, **Tours Information**, and **Transparent Pricing** appear in this quadrant, making them the highest priority for the website. These are the backbone of the user experience and directly align with Clancy Nook’s primary goals of establishing credibility, simplifying bookings, and providing clear information.
  
- **High Importance & Moderate Feasibility**: Features like **Booking Options**, **Group Booking Information**, and **Reviews Access** are essential but require careful implementation. For example, while **Reviews Access** is crucial for building trust and encouraging bookings, the additional design and structural requirements make it slightly more complex to integrate. Nonetheless, it is still a key feature to include, especially as it directly supports the site's credibility and aligns with user needs for confidence in the service.
  
- **Moderate Importance & High Feasibility**: **Social Media Integration** stands out as a low-effort, high-reward feature. Adding social media icons in the footer enhances user engagement and encourages sharing without significantly increasing development complexity.

- **Low Importance & Low Feasibility**: Features like **Supplementary Media**, including brochures and audio snippets, rank lower in priority. While they could enhance the user experience, they are considered optional for the project's minimal viable product (MVP).

---

#### **Project Planning**
This analysis directly informs project planning by providing a clear roadmap for prioritising features during development. Using the _GitHub Projects Board_ [here](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/3/views/2), I can allocate tasks based on importance and feasibility, ensuring high-priority components are delivered first. This approach aligns with the concept of a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**.

The **Scope Plane** in UX design also comes into play here, ensuring that the identified components fit within the project's constraints while still delivering a meaningful experience. By focusing on features in the high-importance/high-feasibility quadrant and working down, the project remains achievable without sacrificing value.

---

### **Scope**
The Scope Plane in UX design addresses the functional and content requirements necessary to fulfil the strategic objectives outlined in the Strategy Plane. While the Strategy Plane defines _why_ the project exists and _who_ it serves, the Scope Plane determines _what_ the website needs to achieve those goals.

The Scope Plane encompasses both **functional requirements** (features and interactivity) and **content requirements** (information and media). These elements work together to deliver a seamless user experience that meets user needs and supports the business objectives. By focusing on the scope early in the process, developers can outline a clear plan that ensures every feature or piece of content serves a defined purpose, avoiding feature creep or misaligned priorities.

For the Clancy Nook website, the Scope Plane is essential to identifying the core features of the website by establishing what functional and content requirements will enable the project to meet its business goals and user needs effectively. The _Components_, _User Stories_, and _Business Goals_ presenting previously play a crucial role in defining and prioritising these requirements, ensuring the project remains focused and aligned with its objectives.

---

#### **Deriving Requirements**
Through this analysis, it becomes evident that the components summarise the essential requirements for the website in terms of what must be achieved to deliver value to both users and the business. These requirements naturally prioritise themselves into three categories: must-have, should-have, and could-have requirements.

---

#### **Content Requirements**
Content requirements are the textual, visual, and aesthetic elements a website needs to meet user needs and fulfil its purpose. They translate the website's strategy and scope into tangible components that align with business goals and user stories.

For Clancy Nook, content requirements provide the _what_ and _how_, filling the website's framework and ensuring users can access relevant materials like tour information, imagery, and branding elements, directly enhancing the site's usability and overall user experience (UX).

Content is the information users interact with on a website. It drives engagement, builds trust, and communicates value. For Clancy Nook, clearly defined content requirements help ensure users can easily read and understand essential information, like tour schedules and pricing and create a visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic to align with the brand's identity.

To ensure a comprehensive and organised development process, the content requirements are divided into the following categories:
- **Graphic Content:** These elements represent visual assets that enhance user engagement and showcase Clancy Nook's unique identity.
- **Textual Content:** Convey essential information and guide users through the website.

#### **Project Planning**
The work in this section has been instrumental in establishing clear acceptance criteria and actionable tasks, which are tracked on my GitHub Projects Board [here](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/3/views/2). This process ensures a focused and efficient approach to meeting user needs and business goals.

In organising and classifying features, I’ve also laid the groundwork for the website’s structure. This strategic planning naturally transitions into the **Structure Plane**, where the flow of information and navigation will align with the core features defined here, ensuring a seamless user experience.

---

### **Structure**
The **Structure Plane** in User Experience (UX) design focuses on how the information within the project is organised and how the users will interact with that information. It bridges the gap between the abstract elements of the strategy and scope and the more concrete aspects of the user interface, defining how the users will experience the navigation and interaction with the website.

The Structure Plane encompasses navigation, which demands a clear and consistent navigation scheme that reflects the importance and relationships of different core features. Additionally, interaction design is essential in defining how users will interact with the website’s interface. This involves deciding on interaction models, selecting appropriate UI elements such as buttons, forms, and sliders, and designing feedback mechanisms that inform users of the system's responses to their actions. Furthermore, developing an effective information architecture is crucial. This includes organising the website content in a logical manner for the target audience and may involve techniques like card sorting to involve users in the organisation process.

For Clancy Nook, this section sets the framework for organising the content and functionality in a way that is intuitive and user-friendly. Key considerations including mapping out the user flow to cover the user stories and ensure that the navigation structure supports these journeys. Maintaining consistent patterns in layout and design is also vital in promoting instinctual navigation through the site as well as sticking to best practice. Furthermore, ensuring that the structure accommodates differently abled users, such as ensuring semantic elements are appropriate and aria-labels are descriptive will ensure screen reader compatibility.

#### **_MoSCoW_ Prioritisation**
So far in this project,  prioritising effectively according to business goals, user needs, and developer capabilities has been crucial. With the project scoped to develop a fully functional front-end site within a specific timeframe, continuously reevaluating priorities and core components ensures timely deployment while balancing essential and additional features.

Effective prioritisation is key for web developers, especially under tight deadlines. To manage this, the MoSCoW prioritisation technique has been integral for me, in categorising tasks. So far, categorising tasks into Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have has allowed me to focus resources effectively and meet critical milestones. Now, I introduce the final component in this model: the Won't-Have.

Introducing Won't-Have's marks a strategic decision to recognise and set aside features that are not feasible at this stage due to current constraints in timeframe, project requirements, skillset, or client resources. This categorisation is not about permanently discarding features but rather temporarily setting aside those that, while valuable, are not possible for the initial launch.

Unlike Could-Have items, which remain on my roadmap for potential inclusion for this project (if time and resources allow), Won't Have elements are not planned for this project phase at all. By clearly defining what will not be included in the initial deployment, I set the stage for future enhancements, as I develop more advanced skills and additional resources are secure by the client. 

Several features have been relocated to the Won't-Have category due to current constraints in skillset, resources, and project scope. Here is a concise breakdown of these features:

- **Community/Concession Rates**
   - Client is still finalising details for community and concession rates.
- **Form Submission Functionality**
   - Real back-end form submission capabilities exceed my current skills, limiting forms to front-end functionality only.
- **Ability to Book on the Website**
   - Direct booking requires back-end skills and integration with reservation and payment systems, which are beyond the current project scope.
- **Supplementary Media like Downloadable Brochures**
   - Absence of client-created content for downloadable brochures delays this feature.

| **Component**             | **Importance** | **Feasibility** | **Priority (MoSCoW)** |

#### **Site Hierarchy**

Site hierarchy refers to the organisation and structure of a website’s content and navigation. It determines how information is grouped, categorised, and accessed by users, impacting how efficiently they can find what they need. A well-structured site hierarchy enhances usability, accessibility, and overall user experience (UX) by guiding users through the website in a logical, intuitive way.

From a UX perspective, site hierarchy plays a crucial role in:
- Ensuring easy navigation so users find key information quickly.
- Minimising frustration by preventing unnecessary clicks or confusion.

When designing a navbar and site structure, **standard best practices** guide how content is prioritised. These principles ensure a good user journey:

1. The homepage 
   - Should always be the first navigation item.  
   - This serves as the starting point for users to explore the site.

2. Pages arranged in a logical order  
   - Main content comes first (e.g., Tours).  
   - Supplementary content follows (e.g., Gallery, Reviews).  
   - Action-oriented items (e.g., Contact) appear last or are highlighted.

3. About sections are commonly integrated into the homepage rather than a standalone page.  
   - Many sites place the About section on the homepage, ensuring quick access while keeping navigation concise.

4. Primary actions should be made visually distinct.  
   - The most important action (e.g., "Contact") should stand out using color or styling.

5. Supporting Functional Pages:  
   - A 404 Error Page ensures that users are properly redirected if they encounter a broken link.  
   - A Success Page provides confirmation after users complete a form submission, reinforcing positive engagement.

By following these principles, the Clancy Nook website will provide an intuitive user experience that aligns with expectations. I have identified which features should be standalone pages and which should exist as sections within pages.

| **Page Name**   | **Purpose** |
|------------|---------|
| **Home**   | Provides an overview of Clancy Nook, highlights key tours, and includes an embedded About section. |
| **Tours**  | Lists all available walking tours, including details on themes, schedules, and booking options. |
| **Gallery** | Showcases images from past tours to visually engage users. |
| **Reviews** | Features testimonials and feedback to build credibility. |
| **Contact** | Provides a contact form, direct contact details, and social media links. |
| **Success Page** | Confirms form submissions, ensuring users know their request was received. |
| **404 Error Page** | Provides an accessible, helpful page when users land on a broken or missing link, guiding them back to relevant content. |

The pyramid diagram visually represents the hierarchical structure of the Clancy Nook website, showing the relationships between the pages based on importance, functionality, user frequency and journey.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/site-hierarchy-pyramid.webp" alt="Pyramid diagram representing the Clancy Nook website's hierarchy." width="400">
</div>

To clearly define the purpose and function of each page, I have assigned labels (_Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, Help, Witness, Worth, Welldone, and Whoops_) to to understand how each page serves user needs and supports Clancy Nook’s business goals.

1. Homepage - _Welcome, What & Why_
   - The homepage acts as the entry point, introducing Clancy Nook and the services provided.
   - As the most visited page, it acts as the primary entry point for users.
   - The About section is placed within the homepage, aligning with standard practices.
   - A brief preview of the available tours designed to engage and attract potential participants.

2. Contact Page _How & Help_
   - Many users will navigate to this page after exploring the site, making it a key component of the hierarchy.
   - Serves a crucial role in the business.
   - Highlighting the "Contact" will encourages users to first explore the site, then take action.  
   - It is visually distinct in the navbar to emphasise its importance.

3. About Section - _Who_
   - Provides essential background on Clancy Nook.
   - While not a standalone page, it is a key section on customer journeys.

2. Tours as the Central Page - _Which, Where & When_
   - Core offering
   - Center page of the customer journey (beyond the starting homepage and ending contact page).

3. Gallery & Reviews as Supporting Pages  - _Witness & Worth_
   - These help build trust and provide additional engagement but are secondary to the tours themselves.
   - Offers a visual representation of past tours, helping potential customers get a feel for the experience.
   - Showcases testimonials from previous customers, reinforcing credibility and trust.

5. Success Page & 404 Page as Supporting Functional Pages - _Welldone & Whoops_
   - The Success Page provides a confirmation message after users submit a form, preventing confusion.  
   - The 404 Error Page ensures users are given helpful redirection options rather than encountering a dead end.

The finalised navbar order follows both best practices and business goals:

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/site-hierarchy-navbar.webp" alt="Diagram of the Clancy Nook website navbar" width="700">
</div>

This ensures a logical and effective user journey, guiding visitors through exploring tours, seeing testimonials, and finally contacting the guide.

The Success Page and 404 Page will exist as functional pages but will not appear in the navigation. Instead:
- The Success Page is triggered after form submissions.
- The 404 Error Page will automatically load if users enter an incorrect or broken URL.

Web designers follow established principles when creating site hierarchy to ensure a seamless experience:

#### **Navigation**
Effective navigation is fundamental to user experience (UX) design, ensuring users can explore the website intuitively while being guided toward key actions. Standard navigation best practices emphasise clarity, consistency, and accessibility, making it easy for users to find what they need while supporting the business’s objectives.

For the Clancy Nook website, navigation is structured to balance free access via the navbar with a logical journey between related pages, aligning with standard web design conventions, user needs, and business goals. Good website navigation follows three key principles:

1. **Predictability** – Users should know where to go next without confusion.  
2. **Efficiency** – Important pages should be accessible within one or two clicks.  
3. **Guidance** – While users can explore freely, the site should encourage a natural progression.

Navigation directly supports Clancy Nook’s business objectives by, promoting tour bookings (where the tours page provide a focal point of the site, with multiple entry points leading users there), building trust (as the reviews and gallery pages reinforce credibility, leading users towards booking), and encouraging engagement (by providing prominent contact options). By structuring the navigation around user intent and business priorities, the site helps new visitors discover Clancy Nook, validate its credibility, and complete a booking inquiry effortlessly.

As a standard web convention, the navbar appears across all pages, giving users immediate access to:

**📌 Home 📌 About 📌 Tours 📌 Gallery 📌 Reviews 📌 Contact**  

This reflects a widely recognized pattern in website navigation, where the website is structured to encourage a natural progression through interconnected pages.

1. **Homepage** serves as the entry point  
2. **About Section** follows, providing background context.  
3. Core service (**Tours Page**) takes central focus.  
4. Supporting content (**Gallery & Reviews Pages**) enhances credibility.  
5. **Contact Page** remains a prominent final step for conversions.

While the Success Page and 404 Error Page are not part of the core navigation, they still play an essential role in the site's user experience. These pages exist within the Clancy Nook website, ensuring users remain within the site's ecosystem.

**🎉 Success ❌🔗 404 Error**

6. **Success Page** provides confirmation after a form submission, reassuring users that their action was completed successfully. It prevents uncertainty and offers a clear next step, such as returning to the homepage or exploring more tours.
7. **404 Error Page**  provides helpful redirection options to guide them back to relevant sections of the site, such as the homepage or tours page. This is if users reach a broken or non-existent link, the 404 page ensures they are not met with frustration.

Certain actions require external platform navigation, integrated seamlessly into the user journey:

**🔗➡️ Booking 🔗➡️ Review 🔗➡️ Social Media**

8. Booking (**Eventbrite**) – Linked from the Tours and Contact pages.  
9. Review Platform (**TripAdvisor**) – Linked from the Reviews page.  
10. **Social Media** – Found in the footer and relevant sections for engagement.

This ensures that while external tools handle bookings and reviews, users always feel anchored within the Clancy Nook website.

This diagram illustrates the navigation of the Clancy Nook website, showing how users can move between core pages such as Home, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact. It also depicts external navigation links to social media, booking, and review platforms, as well as functional pages like the 404 Error and Thank You pages, which guide users when they encounter errors or complete actions.

#### **User Interaction (UI)**
Interaction design plays a crucial role in shaping how users engage with the website’s interface. It involves determining effective interaction models, selecting suitable UI elements like buttons, forms, and sliders, and implementing feedback mechanisms that provide users with clear responses to their actions. The goal is to create an intuitive and engaging experience that aligns with user expectations and business objectives.

Effective interaction design follows industry best practices to ensure intuitive usabiity:

- Provide clear and predictable interactions, minimizing user frustration.
- Implement visual feedback mechanisms (such as hover effects, form validation, and confirmation messages).
- Use sticky navigation or footers for quick access to essential functions.
- Design forms with dropdowns, auto-fill options, and validation messages to enhance usability.
- Ensure smooth scrolling for intuitive page transitions, especially on mobile devices.

The Clancy Nook project applies these best practices while considering previous design decisions to guide users through the site. Therefore: 

1. Navbar elements are designed to be intuitive, ensuring users can easily explore tour options and make inquiries.
2. The footer provides additional navigation buttons, improving accessibility without cluttering the main interface.
3. The booking process is streamlined, with clear CTAs directing users to external platforms such as Eventbrite.
4. Forms use conditional fields, while providing real-time feedback for missing or incorrect inputs.
5. Error handling mechanisms (such as the 404 page) prevent dead ends, guiding users back to relevant content.
6. A success page confirms user actions, ensuring clarity after a form submission.

---

#### Navbar
This is a crucial aspect of user experience, ensuring that users can simply move between different sections of the website. By providing a **sticky** navigation bar that remains at the top of the screen as users scroll. This ensures that users can quickly access key pages without needing to scroll back to the top, improving usability and accessibility. 

---

#### Navicons
A **fixed** footer will remain at the bottom of the page, providing additional navigation buttons for quick access to key areas and social media pages.

#### Buttons
"Text" Buttons will also guide users through the website. 

- **Contact** button is prominently placed to ensure easy access to making enquiries. 
- **Submit** button will be included in the contact form, providing clear action confirmation. 
- **Home**" button will be available on the 404 Error and Success pages, allowing users to easily navigate back to the main site.

Each button will have a corresponding call-to-action, encouraging users to take the next step, whether it's making an inquiry or finalizing a booking.

"Logo" buttons for _Eventbrite_ and _TripAdvisor_ will be placed on the Tours and Reviews pages, respectively. These buttons provide direct access to Eventbrite for booking tours and TripAdvisor for reading and submitting reviews, ensuring a seamless transition to these external platforms.

---

#### Clickable Tour Cards
Another interactive feature designed to enhance user engagement is the clickable tour cards on the homepage. These cards provide a brief summary of each featured tour, giving users an overview of the available experiences. To encourage interaction, users will be able to click on a card, which will take them directly to the corresponding tour section on the Tours page. This will include:

- **Hover Effects**, where the card will expand slightly and a shadow will appear to create a sense of depth.
- A **call-to-action** at the beginning of the section, informing users that they can click on any tour for more details.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-tour-cards.webp" alt="Wireframe of four tour cards displaying tour names and descriptions. One card is highlighted with a shadow effect and a cursor hovering over it, indicating an interactive hover state." width="700">
</div>

---

#### Image Carousel
To enhance the user experience on the Tours pages, image carousels will be implemented, allowing users to easily browse through historic photos of landmarks featured on the tours. These interactive elements provide a dynamic visual preview of the experiences offered, helping potential customers make informed decisions. To balance convenience with interactivity, each carousel will include:

- **Four Photos**

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-carousel.webp" alt="Wireframe of an image carousel with previous and next buttons." width="700">
</div>

---

#### Form Fields
The contact form provides a simple and accessible way for users to ask questions or make inquiries. To improve usability and streamline interactions, several design choices enhance the user experience.

- **Required Fields** prevent form submission unless all necessary details are provided, improving data accuracy.
- **Error Handling** and **Validation** notify users of missing or incorrect entries, prompting them to make corrections before submitting.
- **Dropdown Select** allow users to select predefined options, reducing input errors and making the form easier to complete.
- **Conditional Fields** dynamically appear based on the selected message subject, ensuring users only see relevant input fields, reducing clutter and improving efficiency.
- **Radio Buttons** enable users to quickly select a specific tour, simplifying the booking or inquiry process.
- **Rating Slider** allows users to provide feedback on their experience, offering an intuitive way to rate tours.
- **Image Upload** functionality enables users to submit images (JPEG and PNG formats only), allowing them to share photos relevant to their inquiry or review.
- **Placeholders** guide users through the required fields, ensuring they understand what information is needed.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-form.webp" alt="Wireframe of a contact form with conditional fields in three different states." width="500">
</div>

---

#### **Information Architecture (IA)**
The structuring, organisation, and labelling of website content ensures users can easily navigate and find relevant information. This critical aspect of user experience (UX) design, influences how content is grouped, connected, and accessed.

When designing a website's information architecture, several key principles are considered to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

1. **Hierarchy & Organization**: Content is structured logically, with core pages easily accessible through the navigation bar, and supplementary content grouped into relevant sections.
2. **Logicality & Flow**: The structure follows a natural user journey, ensuring that pages and sections connect in a way that makes sense. Users are guided seamlessly from broad introductory content to specific details, reducing friction and cognitive load.
3. **Findability & Accessibility**: Users should be able to locate key information efficiently, with minimal clicks.
4. **Consistency**: Layout, terminology, and navigation patterns remain uniform across all pages to reduce confusion.
5. **Scalability & Flexibility**: The structure allows for future growth, ensuring new content can be integrated without disrupting usability.

This diagram visualizes information architecture for the site as well as the the hierarchy and relationships between pages, interactive elements, and external links. The structure follows established UX best practices while integrating the project's strategic goals.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/information-architecture.webp" alt="Wireframe of a contact form with conditional fields in three different states." width="700">

#### **Project Planning**
The work in this section has been vital in outlining the website’s structural foundation, ensuring that navigation, interaction, and information architecture align with user expectations and business objectives. These insights have directly have provided critical building blocks for designing the layout, logical flow, and connections between core features, refining the user journey.

All key structural decisions have been translated into actionable development tasks, which are tracked on my GitHub Projects Board [here](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/3/views/2). This ensures an organised approach, maintaining clarity and efficiency in implementing the navigation and interaction elements.

By finalising the structure, I have created a clear roadmap for the next stages of development, seamlessly transitioning into the **Skeleton Plane**. This phase will focus on the site's layout.

---

### **Skeleton**
The Skeleton Plane in UX design builds upon the Structure Plane, refining the foundational layout into a tangible, user-friendly interface. While the Structure Plane established how the website’s content and navigation are organized, the Skeleton Plane focuses on how users interact with these elements, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. This includes defining how navigation, interactive features, and responsiveness contribute to a fluid user journey.

Navigation design was introduced in the Structure Plane to establish a clear hierarchy and logical content flow. In the Skeleton Plane, this concept is further refined into visual and interactive navigation elements that guide users efficiently through the site.

The Skeleton Plane introduces three aspects of user experience:

1. **Interface Design**: Determines the placement of buttons, forms, images, and interactive elements, ensuring they are intuitive and user-friendly.
2. **Information Design**: Focuses on how content is structured and displayed, ensuring readability, accessibility, and logical progression of information.
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensures that the layout, interactive components, and navigation adapt fluidly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, providing a consistent and accessible experience regardless of screen size.

---

#### **Navigation Design**
A well-designed navigation system enhances usability and supports business objectives by guiding visitors toward key actions. In the Skeleton Plane, navigation design is an extension of the structural foundation laid out in the previous phase. While the Structure Plane defined how content is organised and how different sections relate to one another, the Skeleton Plane determines how users see that structure.

When designing a website’s navigation, industry best practices focus on clarity, consistency, and predictability. Standard conventions include:

- **Navigation Bars**: Ensuring the primary navigation is always accessible without users having to scroll back up.
- **Logical Ordering of Menu Items**: Following a structure that mirrors user intent and expected progression.
- **Clear Labels & Readability**: Avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms in navigation links.

Effective navigation also considers the natural progression of a user journey when visiting a website considering: 
- **Predictable Flow**: The navbar, footer navigation, and internal links maintain consistency across all pages, reinforcing intuitive movement.
- **Progressive Discovery**: Content is structured to lead users naturally from exploration (Homepage & Tours) to engagement (Reviews & Gallery) and finally action (Contact & Booking).
- **Interaction & Feedback**: Hover effects, active states, and visual indicators provide clear cues when users engage with navigation elements.

The Clancy Nook website’s navigation follows a hierarchical order that aligns with user expectations:
1. **Homepage** (Overview) – Visitors first need an introduction to Clancy Nook and the experience it offers.
2. **About** (Who Provides the Service?) – Establishing credibility by introducing the guide.
3. **Tours** (What is the Service?) – Providing clear details on what is being offered.
4. **Gallery** & **Reviews** (How Good is the Service?) – Allowing users to see testimonials and images from past tours to build trust.
5. **Contact** (Next Steps – Booking, Inquiry, or Review Submission) – Providing a clear action point to either book a tour, submit a review, or ask a question.

---

#### Navbar
The primary navigation bar (shown in the wireframe) follows these principles by presenting the most relevant pages in a structured and easy-to-scan format. Key design choices include:

- **Sticky Positioning**: Ensures that users always have access to navigation, no matter where they are on the page.
- **Clear Hierarchy**: The order of menu items reflects the natural progression of user interest.
- **Hover Feedback**: When users hover over navigation links, the text is underlined to reinforce interactivity and improve clarity.
- **CTA Emphasis**: The "Contact" button is visually distinct, guiding users toward taking action.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-navbar.webp" alt="Navigation bar design for the Clancy Nook website, displaying menu options" width="700">
</div>

---

#### Footer Navigation
In addition to the primary navbar, the footer navigation serves as a secondary means of guiding users through the site. To maintain simplicity and user familiarity, icons have been carefully chosen based on widely recognized symbols that users instinctively associate with their functions.  
 
- **Additional Access to Core Pages**:  
  The footer contains links to important sections like the **Homepage, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact pages**, reinforcing the primary navigation structure.  
- **Social Media Links**:  
  Icons for **Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn** provide a direct link to Clancy Nook’s presence on these platforms. These choices align with user expectations, ensuring instant recognition and seamless transitions between the website and social media engagement.  
- **Alternative Navigation in Case of Page Errors**:  
  If users land on an **404 Error page**, the footer ensures they can return to the homepage without frustration.  

To enhance usability, the icons and navigation links in the footer will feature hover effects that subtly change color or add a shadow effect when hovered over. This feedback mechanism improves user interaction by reinforcing interactivity, making it clear which elements are clickable and guiding the user effortlessly.  

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-footer.webp" alt="Website footer mockup featuring, social media icons and a small navigation menu with icons." width="700">
</div>

---

#### Access Points & Interactive Elements  
Navigation extends beyond menus—buttons serve as additional access points, ensuring smooth user interactions. These elements are **strategically placed** across the site to align with user intent and facilitate seamless movement between pages and actions.  

- **Call-to-Action** Buttons  
   - **Contact Button**: Encourages users to get in touch for inquiries and bookings.  
   - **Submit Button**: Located within the contact form, ensuring clarity in form submission.  
   - **Home Button**: Appears on the **Success** and **404 Error** pages, helping users return to the main site effortlessly.  

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-buttons.webp" alt="Three buttons labeled 'Contact,' 'Home,' and 'Submit,' designed for user interaction." width="400">
</div>

- **External Links/Logo** Buttons  
   - **Eventbrite Button (on the Tours page)**: Takes users directly to the booking platform.  
   - **TripAdvisor Button (on the Reviews page)**: Provides quick access to customer reviews and the option to submit feedback.  

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/user-interaction-logos.webp" alt="Black circular logo buttons for Eventbrite and TripAdvisor, representing external links for booking tours and reading or writing reviews." width="300">
</div>

These buttons feature a **color change on hover**, reinforcing interactivity and indicating that they are clickable.  

---

#### **Interface and Information Design**
Interface design and information design are key components of the Skeleton Plane in UX, transforming abstract structural decisions into tangible, user-friendly elements.

- **Interface Design** determines how users interact with the site, ensuring that buttons, menus, forms, and other interactive components are intuitive and accessible. It directly impacts usability, influencing how easily users can perform actions such as booking a tour or submitting a review.
- **Information Design** focuses on how content is structured and displayed, ensuring clarity, readability, and logical flow. This encompasses text hierarchy, visual layout, and how information is grouped to guide users through the website.

Both interface and information design work together to create a seamless user experience, making sure the site is both visually coherent and functionally efficient.

The Clancy Nook wireframes follow a mobile-first design approach, prioritizing smaller screens before scaling up to desktop layouts. This ensures optimal usability on smartphones and tablets, where most users will likely access the site.

The wireframes illustrate key interface and information design principles, with a consistent navbar and footer for smooth navigation across all pages, clear sectioning of content, guiding users through an intuitive journey and accessible call-to-actions ensuring easy engagement with tour information, booking links, and reviews.

#### **Project Planning**
The work in this section has been principal in defining the core visual and functional framework of the website, ensuring that interface design, navigation systems, and information architecture are presented well for users. 

The wireframes produced in Balsamiq serve as a crucial reference throughout the development process, providing a clear guide for structuring content, arranging interface elements, and ensuring consistency across devices. These wireframes help bridge the gap between conceptual planning and practical implementation, allowing for an iterative design process where adjustments can be made before committing to full development.  

By finalizing the Skeleton Plane, I have established a solid blueprint for the **Surface Plane**. This stage will focus on refining visual styling, branding consistency, and aesthetic cohesion to enhance the user experience.

---

### **Surface**
The Surface Plane is the final stage of UX design, where structure, interaction, and aesthetics come together to create a visually polished and intuitive interface, shaped by the underlying skeleton. While earlier phases focused on functionality, content organization, and interactivity, this stage refines color schemes, typography, spacing, contrast, and branding consistency to bolster usability and engagement.

Visual design is not just about aesthetics. It plays a crucial role in, branding and guiding users through a fluid experience. Every design choice is intentional, aligning with the strategy, structure, and interaction models developed in previous stages.  

For Clancy Nook, the visual identity is more than just an interface. It embodies the essence of the business. The design reflects the rich storytelling heritage, deep historical connections, and ties to Manchester’s past. The aesthetic approach carefully balances tradition with modern usability, fostering a sense of exploration, discovery, and historical intrigue while ensuring clarity and ease of use for all visitors. Each design element—from typography inspired by historical manuscripts to a warm, inviting color palette that echoes Manchester’s industrial and cultural legacy—has been thoughtfully selected to establish Clancy Nook as a knowledgeable, and engaging tour experience.

I have considered the following visual design principles:

- **Hierarchy & Focus** – Highlighting content as clear focal points, using contrast and typography to guide user attention.
- **Consistency** – Standardising color schemes, spacing, and typography for a cohesive and professional appearance across all pages.
- **Accessibility** – Ensuring WCAG compliance, including high-contrast text, scalable font sizes, and readable typography.
- **Clarity & Readability** – Using clear, legible fonts, adequate line spacing, and structured layouts to improve content consumption.
- **Minimalism & Simplicity** – Removing unnecessary elements to highlight key interactions and maintain a clean, user-friendly experience.

---

#### **Branding & Aesthetic**
Much of the surface plane has been directly influenced by my initial meeting with Louis Cane, where we explored the essence of Clancy Nook’s brand identity. During this discussion, we established a thematic direction rooted in storytelling, history, mystery, and intrigue, forming the core of Clancy Nook’s persona. These discussions guided the design choices, ensuring that every visual aspect of the website aligns with Louis’s existing branding, including the logos and imagery that evoke a sense of exploration and discovery.

These images play a crucial role in this alignment, depicting Louis Cane as Clancy Nook in his tour guide attire, embodying the Victorian-era historian and storyteller that defines his brand. This persona is not just a marketing tool but an integral part of the tour experience itself—when visitors book a tour, they are stepping into a world of curated narratives and historical insights. Therefore, it is vital that his online presence mirrors his in-person identity, ensuring a cohesive brand experience across digital and real-world interactions.

#### **Color Palette**
Color is essential for branding, navigation, and user interaction. The website’s palette balances historical authenticity with modern usability and accessibility. Inspired by Clancy Nook’s branding and Louis Cane’s tour guide persona, the aesthetic reflects Victorian-era storytelling, emphasizing mystery, heritage, and exploration.

To ensure the selected colors met both branding and accessibility requirements, _Adobe Color_ was used to extract a historically resonant yet web-friendly palette. This tool enabled the derivation of primary and secondary hues from key brand imagery, ensuring visual coherence across all design elements.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/color-palette.webp" alt="Clancy Nook color palette" width="600">
</div>

The WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines require a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text to ensure accessibility. Additionally, WCAG 2.1 mandates a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for graphics and user interface components, such as form input borders, ensuring key functional elements are easily distinguishable. For an even higher level of accessibility, WCAG Level AAA requires a 7:1 ratio for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text, benefiting users with more severe visual impairments.

To ensure the Clancy Nook website meets these accessibility standards, I tested various color combinations using _Contrast Checker_. This analysis allows me to determine which color pairings are suitable for different design elements:

1. **High-contrast combinations** (4.5:1 or higher) are reserved for body text and critical information to maximize readability.
2. **Moderate contrast ratios** (3:1 - 4.5:1) are used for larger text elements, such as headings and section titles.
3. **Lower contrast colors** that do not meet accessibility thresholds for text are instead applied to decorative or background elements, ensuring they do not interfere with readability.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/color-contrast-checker.webp" alt="Clancy Nook color contrast validation" width="600">
</div>

The background color for the website was set to **Cream (#F3EED8)** to provide a warm, neutral base that ensures readability without overwhelming users. **Dark Brown (#3C331C)** was chosen for the primary text color, as it maintains a contrast ratio above 4.5:1 against the cream background, meeting accessibility standards for normal text. This pairing ensures that content remains legible across various devices and lighting conditions.

For key navigational elements and interactive components, **Dark Blue (#2B4A4A)** was selected as the navbar background with **Cream (#F3EED8)** text, ensuring an at least 7:1 contrast ratio, compliant with WCAG AAA standards.

Accent colors were incorporated to highlight interactive elements without sacrificing accessibility:

- **Caramel (#EDC479)** serves as a warm highlight color, providing contrast in call-to-action elements and the footer background.
- **Light Blue (#7EA5A2)** adds a cooler accent for visual balance, applied in secondary design elements such as cards and form backgrounds.

The final palette was tested using _Chroma Tool_ for deuteranopia (red-green deficiency), protanopia (red blindness), and tritanopia (blue-yellow deficiency). This ensured that all critical UI elements maintained clear visual contrast across different types of color blindness. This commitment to accessibility aligns with WCAG 2.1 best practices, reinforcing readability and usability for a diverse audience.

#### **Typography**
When designing the Clancy Nook website, I aimed to replicate the original typography used in the Clancy Nook Facebook banner. However, as the exact font was unknown, I turned to _Google Fonts_ to find a close match. After thorough exploration, I selected **IM Fell Double Pica**, a historically inspired serif font that aligns with the brand’s heritage-driven aesthetic.

IM Fell Double Pica offers several advantages:

1. **Legibility**
   - Moderate x-height and well-proportioned letterforms improve clarity.
   - Sufficient spacing between characters enhances readability.
   - Clear differentiation between characters prevents misinterpretation.
2. **Readability**
   - Works well for long text passages, maintaining a comfortable reading flow.
   - Suitable for captions and digital displays, preserving clarity even in smaller sizes.
3. **Visual Fatigue & Adaptability**
   - While its traditional design can lead to visual fatigue in extensive reading, limiting its use to headings and navigational elements ensures a balanced user experience.
   - Adaptable across different devices and languages, maintaining legibility and aesthetic appeal.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/im-fell-double-pica.webp" alt="Clancy Nook secondary font for headers" width="600">
</div>

This font is exclusively for headings and navigation, and to optimize readability, it is applied in UPPERCASE. This decision was made to reinforce Clancy Nook’s historical aesthetic while ensuring that text remains legible and impactful, providing: 

- Improved Clarity
- Enhanced Visibility in Navigation
- Stronger Branding Presence

To complement IM Fell Double Pica’s ornate, old-world feel, I used _FontForge_ to identify a modern, highly readable sans-serif for body text. **Montserrat** was chosen for its clarity, versatility, and strong visual contrast, ensuring seamless readability without detracting from Clancy Nook’s period-inspired branding.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/font-pairing.webp" alt="Clancy Nook font-pairing" width="600">

#### **Imagery**
Visual storytelling plays a crucial role in shaping the Clancy Nook website, immersing users in rich historical narratives while enhancing engagement. Carefully curated imagery, subtle overlays, shadows and dynamic elements work together to create an authentic and visually compelling experience.

---

#### Hero Banners
Hero images serve as focal points across the website, immediately setting the tone for visitors. Hero images are visually striking elements positioned near the top of pages, often spanning its full width. It provides visitors with an immediate introduction to the brand while shaping their first impression and overall user experience.

An effective hero image should:

- Capture attention instantly
- Visually communicate the brand’s value proposition
- Guide users toward relevant content or actions

The homepage hero image, featuring a historical Manchester street in Ancoats, with complementary colors are designed to draw users into the site. A semi-transparent overlay is applied to these images, ensuring text readability while preserving the atmospheric depth and vintage aesthetic.

#### Black & White Imagery
The Clancy Nook website incorporates historical imagery from the Manchester Local Image Collection, a public domain archive documenting the city's evolution. These black-and-white photographs of Victorian streets, industrial districts, and historic landmarks establish a strong sense of place and authenticity, immersing users in the setting before they even step onto a tour.

Black and White Images in Web Design: 

- Lessens distractions
- Offers a minimal aesthetic
- Provides a sophisticated look
- Creates on light, form, and texture
- Doesn't detract from the color palette

This approach aligns with Clancy Nook’s historical branding, drawn heavily from Victorian-era newspaper reports from the 1800s and early 1900s. This choice evokes the feel of archival materials and historical publications, reinforcing the tours’ connection to the past.

<div align="center">

</div>

---

### Gallery
The gallery page is intentionally the most colorful and visually rich section of the website, contrasting with the muted, vintage tones used elsewhere. While other sections focus on historical authenticity with black-and-white images, the gallery embraces full-color photography, emphasising the vibrancy and energy of the tours.

A well-designed website gallery should have:
- High-Quality, Authentic Images
- Seamless Layout
- Immersive Experience
- Diverse Perspectives

The gallery prioritizes high-resolution photos to maintain clarity and professionalism. The borderless, collage-style arrangement ensures that images flow naturally, immersing visitors in the tour experience. This approach minimizes visual clutter and enhances the feeling of continuity between moments. 

A mix of candid, group photos, architectural shots, and historical landmarks create a balanced visual representation, allowing potential customers to envision themselves on the tour, engaging with the locations and narratives.

Most images in the gallery were taken by Louis Cane or were shared by tourists with explicit consent for business use. To maintain transparency and ethical integrity:

- Some images are sourced from free-use libraries, ensuring copyright compliance.
- Third-party photos are used with permission, properly crediting contributors where needed.

To maintain a cohesive and visually appealing design, CSS variables were implemented for the font and color palette. These variables ensured consistency across all pages, making it easier to apply global style changes efficiently. A set of global styles was created to define the primary and secondary colors, typography, and spacing rules. This approach improved maintainability and streamlined the customization process.

#### **Website Development Sequence**

The sequence followed in developing the website at a page level:  

Home Page → Tours Page → Reviews Page → Contact Page → Success & 404 Page → Gallery Page

This structured approach was based on the prioritization set out in the GitHub Projects board [here](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/3/views/2), ensuring that the most critical and user-facing pages were developed first.  

This development order aligns with user experience (UX) best practices, ensuring that essential pages were fully functional before focusing on secondary content. By following the GitHub Projects board, the workflow remained structured, systematically addressing high-priority features first while keeping scope manageable.

The development process was guided by wireframes for each page, generally working sequentially from the top down. Each section was then styled to be responsive, aesthetically consistent and tested in _DevTools_, before proceeding to the next, ensuring alignment with the intended design.

To style each page: 
- **CSS Variables** defined primary and secondary colors and typography
- **Global CSS Styling** ensured consistency across sections without repetitive styling.
- **Bootstrap Utility Classes** declared spacing & alignment
- **Specific CSS Styling** using elemental, class, id and combinator selectors refined the visual appeal of the pages
- **Pseudo-Class CSS Styling** provided visual feedback functionality.

To guarantee full responsiveness:
- **Media queries** were integrated into the stylesheets to ensure seamless adaptation across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Continuous **testing** was conducted throughout development to maintain optimal usability and aesthetics across various devices.

**Gallery**

Structure and Functionality
- The gallery is nested within main element id="gallery".  
- The images are grouped into three sections to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes:  
  - Small Screens – A simple stacked layout where images appear in a single column for easy scrolling.  
  - Medium Screens – A structured grid layout.  
  - Large Screens – A multi-column flexbox layout, optimizing aesthetic balance and visual appeal.  
- Images are wrapped in div elements.  

Responsiveness and Styling
- Small Screens (Mobile) – d-block d-sm-none

   - Images are equally distributed.  
- Large Screens (Desktops) – d-none d-lg-block  
   - A multi-row and multi-column layout, allowing for a more expansive gallery view.  
- Image Sizing and Positioning  
   - The `g-0` and `p-0` classes remove unwanted spacing, ensuring that images appear seamlessly aligned.  
   - The `img-fluid` class is applied to each `<img>` tag, making images scale dynamically within their containers.  
   - The `object-fit-cover` property ensures images maintain aspect ratios without distortion.  
   - The gallery is grid-based, ensuring a balanced visual hierarchy.  
   - Larger images are strategically placed to emphasize key moments, such as group shots or historic buildings.  
   - Smaller images are interwoven to create variety while maintaining alignment.
   - `img-fluid` and `object-fit-cover` ensure images remain properly scaled and cropped.  
   - Horizontal and vertical images are consistently cropped to maintain a visually balanced layout.   
- Contrast and Background Integration  
   - The gallery’s background is neutral, allowing the images to stand out.  
   - The color contrast ensures that the images are clearly visible across different lighting conditions.
