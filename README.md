# **User Experience** (2)
User experience (UX) design focuses on creating meaningful, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and a product or service. For a website, this means designing a platform that meets users’ needs while providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

Prioritising user experience is essential to ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the site, achieve their goals, and enjoy the process. This is particularly relevant to the Clancy Nook website, where the goal was to cater to a diverse audience of locals, tourists, and corporate clients.

## **Strategy** (2.1)
The **Strategy Plane** in UX design formed the foundation of the project by aligning business goals with user needs. It addressed fundamental questions about what the website aimed to achieve and how it delivered value to its users.

For Clancy Nook, this meant not only creating an online presence but also ensuring the site served as a seamless gateway for users to learn about, book, and engage with the historic walking tours offered. The strategy plane was the first port of call in the development process, as it established the overall purpose of the site and guided all subsequent design and development decisions.

### **Initial Discussion**

The development process for the Clancy Nook website began with an in-depth meeting with the client, Louis Cane. During this discussion, we explored key aspects of the business, including:

- The primary goals for the business and the website.
- Insights into Clancy Nook’s past operations, including its use of Linktree, TripAdvisor, and Eventbrite.
- Previous clientele and anticipated future clientele.
- Future goals to expand the business by attracting more corporate clients and building partnerships with community organizations. 

### **Business Goals**

The following business goals were established for the Clancy Nook website during the initial discussion phase. These goals emerged from a collaborative dialogue with the client, focusing on both immediate needs and aspirations for the future. While some goals centered on creating a strong digital presence and improving user experience, others reflected long-term ambitions, such as attracting corporate clients and collaborating with local communities.

Each business goal was paired with a corresponding call-to-action (CTA) designed to:

- Guide users toward desired actions such as booking a tour, learning more about the guide, or contacting for corporate inquiries.
- Make the website's purpose immediately clear to visitors.

1. Establish Online Presence  
   Created a professional and user-friendly website to build credibility for Clancy Nook as a premier provider of historic walking tours in Manchester.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Discover Clancy Nook and explore Manchester's rich history with our guided walking tours. Visit my website to learn more and join our community of history enthusiasts."_

2. Simplify Booking  
   Integrated seamless links to Eventbrite for easy tour booking while showcasing a personalized contact option for inquiries.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Book your spot on a Clancy Nook walking tour today through our seamless Eventbrite integration or contact me directly for inquiries."_

3. Showcase Unique Value  
   Highlighted Louis Cane's deep knowledge of Manchester's history and the engaging storytelling that set Clancy Nook apart from other tours.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Experience Manchester’s history like never before with Clancy Nook, your expert guide and storyteller."_

4. Provide a Central Hub for Tour Information  
   Served as a central resource for tour details, showcasing engaging images, insightful descriptions, and glowing testimonials to entice potential customers.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Find all the details you need in one place—tour schedules, meeting points, and reviews—all at your fingertips."_

5. Encourage Repeat Customers  
   Built customer loyalty by offering exclusive updates on new tours or events through an optional newsletter signup.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Stay in the loop! Follow us on social media for updates on new tours and exclusive events."_

6. Attract Corporate Clients (Future Goal)  
   Expanded Clancy Nook's reach to the corporate world by showcasing tailored private tours for businesses, including team-building events, company outings, and cultural excursions.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Looking for a unique team-building experience? Contact me to arrange private walking tours."_

7. Facilitate Opportunities to Work with Communities (Future Goal)  
   Fostered connections with local communities by offering concession rates or free tours for underserved groups, contributing to the city’s cultural inclusivity.  
   *Call-to-Action:* _"Partner with Clancy Nook to make history accessible to all. Reach out for details about our community-focused tour initiatives."_

Goals 6 and 7, while not central to the website's initial development, represented aspirational objectives for the business’s growth and social impact. By planting the seeds for these initiatives early on, the site could evolve over time to accommodate these long-term ambitions.

### **User Demographics ** 

Understanding who attended and booked Clancy Nook tours helped establish clear user demographics. This process allowed for the identification of key user groups, their needs, and their motivations. These insights informed the development of tailored user stories and features for the website. By analyzing the clientele and tour attendance patterns, we aligned the website's functionality and content with the expectations of the target audience. This ensured that every feature and piece of information on the site resonated with its users and provided maximum value.

The demographics were broken down by tour type to account for the unique audience profiles each tour attracted:

- **City Center Tour:**  
  - 60-70% Mancunians: Local history enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of the city.  
  - 20-30% Tourists or Visitors: Out-of-town guests looking to explore Manchester's cultural and historical highlights.  
  - Diverse audience mix, including families, students, and older adults.

- **Whalley Range Tour:**  
  - Majority local residents: Individuals with a vested interest in the area's history or personal connections.  
  - New residents: Those wanting to learn about the neighborhood they now call home.  
  - Former residents: Occasional attendees revisiting for nostalgic reasons.

- **Ancoats Tour:**  
  - 80-90% from the wider Manchester region: Predominantly history enthusiasts who appreciated the industrial heritage of Ancoats.  
  - Currently lacking local attendance: Attracting Ancoats locals remained a growth area and a goal for the tour guide.

### **Target Audiences**  

The insights gathered from the demographic analysis and business goals allowed us to define the following target audiences for the Clancy Nook website. Each audience group aligned with specific business goals, helping to establish clear connections between user needs and the website's features.

1. New Users - Prospective Customers  
   First-time visitors exploring Clancy Nook and seeking information about tours to decide on booking.

2. Returning Users  
   Loyal customers looking for updates, new tours, and opportunities to engage further.

3. Locals  
   Residents of Manchester or surrounding areas interested in deepening their connection to the city’s history.

4. Tourists  
   Visitors to Manchester who wanted to learn about its cultural and historical highlights in an engaging way.

5. Corporate Users (Businesses) - Prospective Customers  
   Businesses interested in private tours for team-building events, company outings, or corporate retreats.

6. Community Leaders (Non-profits/Schools) - Prospective Customers  
   Organizations looking to collaborate with Clancy Nook for concession-priced or free educational tours tailored to their needs.

### **User Stories**  

For this project, user stories were developed to capture the diverse needs of Clancy Nook’s target audience, ensuring the website provided a user-centric experience. The creation of user stories helped define what different user groups—such as locals, tourists, corporate clients, and returning users—expected from the website. These stories bridged the gap between user needs and the technical development process, ensuring every feature contributed to a positive user experience and served as a roadmap for development and design decisions.  

To ensure effective and timely delivery, the user stories were divided into three priority categories: must-have, should-have, and could-have. These categories reflected the essential, important, and desirable features for the website.

- **Must-Have** stories represented the core functionalities that the website could not succeed without. These included fundamental aspects like clear navigation, booking instructions, a contact form, and reviews.  
- **Should-Have** stories included features that enhanced the user experience and catered to specific user groups, such as social media links and private tour information.  
- **Could-Have** stories consisted of advanced or supplementary features that, while not essential, would add extra value if implemented, such as downloadable brochures or storytelling audio clips.  

This prioritization ensured critical features were developed first while leaving room for additional improvements based on time and resources.

### **Emerging Website Components**

The analysis of user needs and expectations highlighted several critical components that formed the foundation of the Clancy Nook website. These components were designed to address the goals of both the business and its diverse user base, ensuring a user-friendly, informative, and engaging experience. Below are the core website components that emerged during the planning phase:

1. About Section  
   Including information about the guide’s historical knowledge and storytelling abilities emphasized the unique value Clancy Nook offered, particularly appealing to locals and history enthusiasts.

10. Supplementary Media  
    Supplementary resources, such as downloadable PDFs or brochures for corporate and private tours, provided businesses with shareable materials to aid in internal planning. Additionally, audio or video snippets of the guide’s storytelling offered a unique preview of the experience for prospective customers, enticing them to book a tour.

### **Importance/Feasibility**

The Importance/Feasibility analysis evaluated each website component based on two criteria: importance and feasibility. Importance referred to how critical the component was to achieving the business goals and addressing user needs outlined in the user stories. Feasibility, on the other hand, assessed the practicality of implementing the component within the project's constraints (e.g., timeline, resources, and technical expertise).

This analysis ensured that the development process prioritized components that delivered the most value while remaining achievable. By striking this balance, the project remained focused and efficient, delivering the maximum possible impact within its constraints.

The table below rated each component on a scale of 1 to 5 for both importance and feasibility:

- **Importance:** A rating of 1 meant the component had low relevance to business goals or user stories, while a 5 signified that the component was essential.
- **Feasibility:** A rating of 1 indicated that the component was difficult to implement within the project's constraints, while a 5 meant it was straightforward to achieve.

| **Component**             | **Importance** | **Feasibility** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| About Section             | 5              | 5               |
| Tours Information         | 4              | 4               |
| Booking Options           | 4              | 3               |
| Contact Form              | 5              | 4               |
| Transparent Pricing       | 3              | 5               |
| Group Booking Information | 3              | 4               |
| Reviews Access            | 4              | 2               |
| Image Gallery             | 3              | 3               |
| Social Media Integration  | 3              | 5               |

Components in other quadrants help identify where compromises or adjustments may be needed.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/importance-viability-graph.webp" alt="Graph to show the importance/viability of different website components defined by Business Goals and User Stories" width="700">
</div>

Graph Insights:
- **High Importance & High Feasibility**: Components such as the **About Section**, **Contact Form**, **Tours Information**, and **Transparent Pricing** appear in this quadrant, making them the highest priority for the website. These are the backbone of the user experience and directly align with Clancy Nook’s primary goals of establishing credibility, simplifying bookings, and providing clear information.
  
- **High Importance & Moderate Feasibility**: Features like **Booking Options**, **Group Booking Information**, and **Reviews Access** are essential but require careful implementation. For example, while **Reviews Access** is crucial for building trust and encouraging bookings, the additional design and structural requirements make it slightly more complex to integrate. Nonetheless, it is still a key feature to include, especially as it directly supports the site's credibility and aligns with user needs for confidence in the service.
  
- **Moderate Importance & High Feasibility**: **Social Media Integration** stands out as a low-effort, high-reward feature. Adding social media icons in the footer enhances user engagement and encourages sharing without significantly increasing development complexity.

- **Low Importance & Low Feasibility**: Features like **Supplementary Media**, including brochures and audio snippets, rank lower in priority. While they could enhance the user experience, they are considered optional for the project's minimal viable product (MVP).

## Scope (2.2)

The Scope Plane in UX design addressed the functional and content requirements necessary to fulfill the strategic objectives outlined in the Strategy Plane. While the Strategy Plane defined _why_ the project existed and _who_ it served, the Scope Plane determined _what_ the website needed to achieve those goals.

For the Clancy Nook website, the Scope Plane was essential to identifying the core features of the website by establishing what functional and content requirements enabled the project to meet its business goals and user needs effectively. The components, user stories, and business goals presented previously played a crucial role in defining and prioritizing these requirements, ensuring the project remained focused and aligned with its objectives.

### **Deriving Requirements**

Through this analysis, it became evident that the components summarized the essential requirements for the website in terms of what had to be achieved to deliver value to both users and the business. These requirements naturally prioritized themselves into three categories: must-have, should-have, and could-have requirements.

Content requirements defined the textual, visual, and aesthetic elements a website needed to meet user needs and fulfill its purpose. They translated the website's strategy and scope into tangible components that aligned with business goals and user stories.

For Clancy Nook, content requirements provided the _what_ and _how_, filling the website's framework and ensuring users could access relevant materials like tour information, imagery, and branding elements. These requirements directly enhanced the site's usability and overall user experience (UX).

Content was the information users interacted with on a website. It drove engagement, built trust, and communicated value. For Clancy Nook, clearly defined content requirements ensured users could easily read and understand essential information, such as tour schedules and pricing, while also creating a visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic to align with the brand's identity.

To ensure a comprehensive and organized development process, the content requirements were divided into the following categories:
- **Graphic Content:** Visual assets that enhanced user engagement and showcased Clancy Nook's unique identity.
- **Textual Content:** Essential information guiding users through the website.

## Structure (2.3)

The **Structure Plane** in User Experience (UX) design focused on how the information within the project was organized and how users interacted with that information. It bridged the gap between the abstract elements of strategy and scope and the more concrete aspects of the user interface, defining how users experienced navigation and interaction with the website.

The Structure Plane encompassed navigation, which required a clear and consistent navigation scheme that reflected the importance and relationships of different core features. Additionally, interaction design played a key role in defining how users engaged with the website’s interface. This involved deciding on interaction models, selecting appropriate UI elements such as buttons, forms, and sliders, and designing feedback mechanisms that informed users of the system's responses to their actions. Furthermore, developing an effective information architecture was crucial. This included organizing website content in a logical manner for the target audience and often involved techniques like card sorting to involve users in the organization process.

For Clancy Nook, this section set the framework for structuring content and functionality in an intuitive and user-friendly way. Key considerations included mapping out the user flow to cover the user stories and ensuring that the navigation structure supported these journeys. Maintaining consistent patterns in layout and design was also vital in promoting instinctual navigation throughout the site while adhering to best practices. Additionally, the structure was designed to accommodate differently-abled users by ensuring semantic elements were appropriately used and ARIA labels were descriptive to support screen reader compatibility.

### _MoSCoW_ Prioritization

Throughout the project, effective prioritization according to business goals, user needs, and developer capabilities was crucial. With the project scoped to develop a fully functional front-end site within a specific timeframe, continuously reevaluating priorities and core components ensured timely deployment while balancing essential and additional features.

Prioritization was key for managing the project under tight deadlines. To achieve this, the **MoSCoW prioritization technique** was used to categorize tasks. Initially, tasks were divided into **Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have** categories to allocate resources effectively and meet critical milestones. However, as the project progressed, the final component in this model was introduced: the **Won't-Have** category.

Introducing **Won't-Have** items marked a strategic decision to recognize and set aside features that were not feasible within the current constraints of timeframe, project requirements, skillset, or client resources. This categorization was not about permanently discarding features but rather temporarily deferring those that, while valuable, were not viable for the initial launch.

Unlike **Could-Have** items, which remained on the roadmap for potential inclusion if time and resources allowed, **Won't-Have** elements were explicitly not planned for this project phase. By clearly defining what would not be included in the initial deployment, a foundation was set for future enhancements as skills advanced and additional client resources were secured.

Several features were relocated to the **Won't-Have** category due to limitations in skillset, resources, and project scope. Below is a breakdown of these features:

- **Community/Concession Rates**  
  - The client was still finalizing details for community and concession rates, preventing their immediate inclusion.

- **Form Submission Functionality**  
  - Implementing real back-end form submission capabilities exceeded the current skill level, limiting forms to front-end functionality only.

- **Ability to Book on the Website**  
  - Direct booking required back-end skills and integration with reservation and payment systems, which were beyond the scope of this project.

- **Supplementary Media like Downloadable Brochures**  
  - The absence of client-created content for downloadable brochures delayed the implementation of this feature.

By defining **Won’t-Have** items early in the development process, the project maintained focus on delivering a high-quality, fully functional front-end website while ensuring room for future growth and improvements.

### **Site Hierarchy**

Site hierarchy referred to the organization and structure of a website’s content and navigation. It determined how information was grouped, categorized, and accessed by users, impacting how efficiently they could find what they needed. A well-structured site hierarchy enhanced usability, accessibility, and overall user experience (UX) by guiding users through the website in a logical, intuitive way.

From a UX perspective, site hierarchy played a crucial role in:
- Ensuring easy navigation so users could find key information quickly.
- Minimizing frustration by preventing unnecessary clicks or confusion.

When designing a navbar and site structure, **standard best practices** guided how content was prioritized. These principles ensured a good user journey:

1. **The homepage**  
   - Always served as the first navigation item.  
   - Acted as the starting point for users to explore the site.

2. **Pages arranged in a logical order**  
   - Main content appeared first (e.g., Tours).  
   - Supplementary content followed (e.g., Gallery, Reviews).  
   - Action-oriented items (e.g., Contact) appeared last or were highlighted.

3. **About sections were commonly integrated into the homepage rather than a standalone page.**  
   - Many sites placed the About section on the homepage, ensuring quick access while keeping navigation concise.

4. **Primary actions were made visually distinct.**  
   - The most important action (e.g., "Contact") stood out using color or styling.

5. **Supporting functional pages:**  
   - A **404 Error Page** ensured that users were properly redirected if they encountered a broken link.  
   - A **Success Page** provided confirmation after users completed a form submission, reinforcing positive engagement.

By following these principles, the Clancy Nook website provided an intuitive user experience that aligned with expectations. The project identified which features should be standalone pages and which should exist as sections within pages.

| **Page Name**   | **Purpose** |
|------------|---------|
| **Home**   | Provides an overview of Clancy Nook, highlights key tours, and includes an embedded About section. |
| **Tours**  | Lists all available walking tours, including details on themes, schedules, and booking options. |
| **Gallery** | Showcases images from past tours to visually engage users. |
| **Reviews** | Features testimonials and feedback to build credibility. |
| **Contact** | Provides a contact form, direct contact details, and social media links. |
| **Success Page** | Confirms form submissions, ensuring users know their request was received. |
| **404 Error Page** | Provides an accessible, helpful page when users land on a broken or missing link, guiding them back to relevant content. |

The pyramid diagram visually represents the hierarchical structure of the Clancy Nook website, showing the relationships between the pages based on importance, functionality, user frequency and journey.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/site-hierarchy-pyramid.webp" alt="Pyramid diagram representing the Clancy Nook website's hierarchy." width="400">
</div>

To clearly define the purpose and function of each page, labels (_Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, Help, Witness, Worth, Welldone, and Whoops_) were assigned to understand how each page served user needs and supported Clancy Nook’s business goals.

1. **Homepage - _Welcome, What & Why_**  
   - Acted as the entry point, introducing Clancy Nook and the services provided.  
   - As the most visited page, it served as the primary starting point for users.  
   - The About section was placed within the homepage, aligning with standard practices.  
   - Provided a brief preview of available tours designed to engage and attract potential participants.

2. **Contact Page - _How & Help_**  
   - Many users navigated to this page after exploring the site, making it a key component of the hierarchy.  
   - Served a crucial role in the business by facilitating user inquiries.  
   - Highlighting "Contact" encouraged users to first explore the site and then take action.  
   - It was visually distinct in the navbar to emphasize its importance.

3. **About Section - _Who_**  
   - Provided essential background on Clancy Nook.  
   - While not a standalone page, it was a key section in the customer journey.

4. **Tours as the Central Page - _Which, Where & When_**  
   - Represented the core offering of the business.  
   - Served as the center page of the customer journey, following the homepage and preceding the contact page.

5. **Gallery & Reviews as Supporting Pages - _Witness & Worth_**  
   - Helped build trust and provided additional engagement but were secondary to the tours themselves.  
   - Offered a visual representation of past tours, helping potential customers get a feel for the experience.  
   - Showcased testimonials from previous customers, reinforcing credibility and trust.

6. **Success Page & 404 Page as Supporting Functional Pages - _Welldone & Whoops_**  
   - The Success Page provided a confirmation message after users submitted a form, preventing confusion.  
   - The 404 Error Page ensured users were given helpful redirection options rather than encountering a dead end.

The finalized navbar order followed both best practices and business goals:

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/site-hierarchy-navbar.webp" alt="Diagram of the Clancy Nook website navbar" width="700">
</div>

This structure ensured a logical and effective user journey, guiding visitors through exploring tours, seeing testimonials, and finally contacting the guide.

The **Success Page** and **404 Page** existed as functional pages but were not included in the navigation. Instead:
- The Success Page was triggered after form submissions.
- The 404 Error Page automatically loaded if users entered an incorrect or broken URL.

### **Navigation**

Effective navigation was fundamental to user experience (UX) design, ensuring users could explore the website intuitively while being guided toward key actions. Standard navigation best practices emphasized clarity, consistency, and accessibility, making it easy for users to find what they needed while supporting the business’s objectives.

For the Clancy Nook website, navigation was structured to balance free access via the navbar with a logical journey between related pages, aligning with standard web design conventions, user needs, and business goals. Good website navigation followed three key principles:

1. **Predictability** – Users should know where to go next without confusion.  
2. **Efficiency** – Important pages should be accessible within one or two clicks.  
3. **Guidance** – While users could explore freely, the site should encourage a natural progression.

Navigation directly supported Clancy Nook’s business objectives by:
- **Promoting tour bookings** – The tours page served as a focal point of the site, with multiple entry points leading users there.  
- **Building trust** – The reviews and gallery pages reinforced credibility, leading users towards booking.  
- **Encouraging engagement** – The site provided prominent contact options to make inquiries easy.

By structuring the navigation around user intent and business priorities, the site helped new visitors discover Clancy Nook, validate its credibility, and complete a booking inquiry effortlessly.

As a standard web convention, the navbar appears across all pages, giving users immediate access to:

**📌 Home 📌 About 📌 Tours 📌 Gallery 📌 Reviews 📌 Contact**  

This reflected a widely recognized pattern in website navigation, where the website was structured to encourage a natural progression through interconnected pages.

1. **Homepage** served as the entry point.  
2. **About Section** followed, providing background context.  
3. Core service (**Tours Page**) took central focus.  
4. Supporting content (**Gallery & Reviews Pages**) enhanced credibility.  
5. **Contact Page** remained a prominent final step for conversions.

While the **Success Page** and **404 Error Page** were not part of the core navigation, they still played an essential role in the site's user experience. These pages existed within the Clancy Nook website, ensuring users remained within the site's ecosystem.

**🎉 Success ❌🔗 404 Error**  

6. **Success Page** provided confirmation after a form submission, reassuring users that their action was completed successfully. It prevented uncertainty and offered a clear next step, such as returning to the homepage or exploring more tours.  
7. **404 Error Page** provided helpful redirection options to guide users back to relevant sections of the site, such as the homepage or tours page. If users reached a broken or non-existent link, the 404 page ensured they were not met with frustration.

Certain actions required external platform navigation, integrated seamlessly into the user journey:

**🔗➡️ Booking 🔗➡️ Review 🔗➡️ Social Media**

8. **Booking (Eventbrite)** – Linked from the Tours and Contact pages.  
9. **Review Platform (TripAdvisor)** – Linked from the Reviews page.  
10. **Social Media** – Found in the footer and relevant sections for engagement.

This ensured that while external tools handled bookings and reviews, users always felt anchored within the Clancy Nook website.

This diagram illustrates the navigation of the Clancy Nook website, showing how users can move between core pages such as Home, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact. It also depicts external navigation links to social media, booking, and review platforms, as well as functional pages like the 404 Error and Thank You pages, which guide users when they encounter errors or complete actions.

</div>

### **User Interaction (UI)**  

Interaction design played a crucial role in shaping how users engaged with the website’s interface. It involved determining effective interaction models, selecting suitable UI elements like buttons, forms, and sliders, and implementing feedback mechanisms that provided users with clear responses to their actions. The goal was to create an intuitive and engaging experience that aligned with user expectations and business objectives.

Effective interaction design followed industry best practices to ensure intuitive usability:

- Provided clear and predictable interactions, minimizing user frustration.  
- Implemented visual feedback mechanisms (such as hover effects, form validation, and confirmation messages).  
- Used sticky navigation or footers for quick access to essential functions.  
- Designed forms with dropdowns, auto-fill options, and validation messages to enhance usability.  
- Ensured smooth scrolling for intuitive page transitions, especially on mobile devices.  

The Clancy Nook project applied these best practices while considering previous design decisions to guide users through the site. Therefore:

1. Navbar elements were designed to be intuitive, ensuring users could easily explore tour options and make inquiries.  
2. The footer provided additional navigation buttons, improving accessibility without cluttering the main interface.  
3. The booking process was streamlined, with clear CTAs directing users to external platforms such as Eventbrite.  
4. Forms used conditional fields while providing real-time feedback for missing or incorrect inputs.  
5. Error handling mechanisms (such as the 404 page) prevented dead ends, guiding users back to relevant content.  
6. A success page confirmed user actions, ensuring clarity after a form submission.  

#### Navbar  

The navbar was a crucial aspect of user experience, ensuring that users could easily move between different sections of the website. A **sticky navigation bar** remained at the top of the screen as users scrolled, ensuring quick access to key pages without needing to scroll back up. This improved usability and accessibility.

#### Navicons  

A **fixed footer** remained at the bottom of the page, providing additional navigation buttons for quick access to key areas and social media pages.

#### Buttons  

Text-based buttons were used to guide users through the website.  

- **Contact** button was prominently placed to ensure easy access to making inquiries.  
- **Submit** button was included in the contact form, providing clear action confirmation.  
- **Home** button was available on the 404 Error and Success pages, allowing users to easily navigate back to the main site.  

Each button had a corresponding **call-to-action**, encouraging users to take the next step, whether it was making an inquiry or finalizing a booking.

**Logo buttons** for _Eventbrite_ and _TripAdvisor_ were placed on the Tours and Reviews pages, respectively. These buttons provided direct access to Eventbrite for booking tours and TripAdvisor for reading and submitting reviews, ensuring a seamless transition to these external platforms.

#### Clickable Tour Cards  

Another interactive feature designed to enhance user engagement was the **clickable tour cards** on the homepage. These cards provided a brief summary of each featured tour, giving users an overview of the available experiences. To encourage interaction, users could click on a card, which would take them directly to the corresponding tour section on the **Tours** page.  

This feature included:  

- **Hover Effects**, where the card would expand slightly and a shadow would appear to create a sense of depth.  
- A **call-to-action** at the beginning of the section, informing users that they could click on any tour for more details.

### **Information Architecture (IA)**
The structuring, organization, and labeling of website content ensured that users could easily navigate and find relevant information. This critical aspect of user experience (UX) design influenced how content was grouped, connected, and accessed.

When designing a website's information architecture, several key principles were considered to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

1. **Hierarchy & Organization**: Content is structured logically, with core pages easily accessible through the navigation bar, and supplementary content grouped into relevant sections.
2. **Logicality & Flow**: The structure follows a natural user journey, ensuring that pages and sections connect in a way that makes sense. Users are guided seamlessly from broad introductory content to specific details, reducing friction and cognitive load.
3. **Findability & Accessibility**: Users should be able to locate key information efficiently, with minimal clicks.
4. **Consistency**: Layout, terminology, and navigation patterns remain uniform across all pages to reduce confusion.
5. **Scalability & Flexibility**: The structure allows for future growth, ensuring new content can be integrated without disrupting usability.

This diagram visualizes information architecture for the site as well as the the hierarchy and relationships between pages, interactive elements, and external links. The structure follows established UX best practices while integrating the project's strategic goals.

## **Skeleton** (2.4)
The **Skeleton Plane** in UX design built upon the **Structure Plane**, refining the foundational layout into a tangible, user-friendly interface. While the Structure Plane established how the website’s content and navigation were organized, the Skeleton Plane focused on how users interacted with these elements, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. This included defining how navigation, interactive features, and responsiveness contributed to a fluid user journey.

Navigation design was introduced in the Structure Plane to establish a clear hierarchy and logical content flow. In the **Skeleton Plane**, this concept was further refined into visual and interactive navigation elements that efficiently guided users through the site.

The Skeleton Plane introduces three aspects of user experience:

1. **Interface Design**: Determines the placement of buttons, forms, images, and interactive elements, ensuring they are intuitive and user-friendly.
2. **Information Design**: Focuses on how content is structured and displayed, ensuring readability, accessibility, and logical progression of information.
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensures that the layout, interactive components, and navigation adapt fluidly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, providing a consistent and accessible experience regardless of screen size.

### **Navigation Design**
A well-designed navigation system enhanced usability and supported business objectives by guiding visitors toward key actions. In the Skeleton Plane, navigation design was an extension of the structural foundation laid out in the previous phase. While the Structure Plane defined how content was organized and how different sections related to one another, the Skeleton Plane determined how users visually perceived that structure.

When designing a website’s navigation, industry best practices focused on clarity, consistency, and predictability. Standard conventions included:

- **Navigation Bars**: Ensuring the primary navigation was always accessible without users having to scroll back up.  
- **Logical Ordering of Menu Items**: Following a structure that mirrored user intent and expected progression.  
- **Clear Labels & Readability**: Avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms in navigation links.  

Effective navigation also considered the natural progression of a user journey when visiting a website, taking into account:  

- **Predictable Flow**: The navbar, footer navigation, and internal links maintained consistency across all pages, reinforcing intuitive movement.  
- **Progressive Discovery**: Content was structured to lead users naturally from exploration (**Homepage & Tours**) to engagement (**Reviews & Gallery**) and finally to action (**Contact & Booking**).  
- **Interaction & Feedback**: Hover effects, active states, and visual indicators provided clear cues when users engaged with navigation elements.  

The Clancy Nook website’s navigation followed a hierarchical order that aligned with user expectations:  

1. **Homepage** (_Overview_) – Visitors first needed an introduction to Clancy Nook and the experience it offered.  
2. **About** (_Who Provides the Service?_) – Established credibility by introducing the guide.  
3. **Tours** (_What is the Service?_) – Provided clear details on what was being offered.  
4. **Gallery** & **Reviews** (_How Good is the Service?_) – Allowed users to see testimonials and images from past tours to build trust.  
5. **Contact** (_Next Steps – Booking, Inquiry, or Review Submission_) – Provided a clear action point to either book a tour, submit a review, or ask a question.  

#### Navbar
The primary navigation bar (as shown in the wireframe) followed these principles by presenting the most relevant pages in a structured and easy-to-scan format. Key design choices included:

- **Sticky Positioning**: Ensured that users always had access to navigation, no matter where they were on the page.  
- **Clear Hierarchy**: The order of menu items reflected the natural progression of user interest.  
- **Hover Feedback**: When users hovered over navigation links, the text was underlined to reinforce interactivity and improve clarity.  
- **CTA Emphasis**: The "Contact" button was visually distinct, guiding users toward taking action.

</div>

#### Footer Navigation
In addition to the primary navbar, the footer navigation served as a secondary means of guiding users through the site. To maintain simplicity and user familiarity, icons were carefully chosen based on widely recognized symbols that users instinctively associated with their functions.  

- **Additional Access to Core Pages**:  
  The footer contained links to important sections like the **Homepage, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact pages**, reinforcing the primary navigation structure.  

- **Social Media Links**:  
  Icons for **Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn** provided direct links to Clancy Nook’s presence on these platforms. These choices aligned with user expectations, ensuring instant recognition and seamless transitions between the website and social media engagement.  

- **Alternative Navigation in Case of Page Errors**:  
  If users landed on a **404 Error page**, the footer ensures they could return to the homepage without frustration.  

To enhance usability, the icons and navigation links in the footer featured **hover effects** that subtly changed color or added a shadow effect when hovered over. This feedback mechanism improved user interaction by reinforcing interactivity, making it clear which elements were clickable and guiding users effortlessly.

## **Surface** (2.5)

The Surface Plane was the final stage of UX design, where structure, interaction, and aesthetics came together to create a visually polished and intuitive interface, shaped by the underlying skeleton. While earlier phases focused on functionality, content organization, and interactivity, this stage refined color schemes, typography, spacing, contrast, and branding consistency to enhance usability and engagement.

For Clancy Nook, the visual identity was more than just an interface—it embodied the essence of the business. The design reflected rich storytelling heritage, deep historical connections, and ties to Manchester’s past. The aesthetic approach carefully balanced tradition with modern usability, fostering a sense of exploration, discovery, and historical intrigue while ensuring clarity and ease of use for all visitors.  

Each design element—from typography inspired by historical manuscripts to a warm, inviting color palette echoing Manchester’s industrial and cultural legacy—was thoughtfully selected to establish Clancy Nook as a knowledgeable and engaging tour experience.

The following visual design principles were considered:

- **Hierarchy & Focus** – Highlighting content as clear focal points, using contrast and typography to guide user attention.  
- **Consistency** – Standardizing color schemes, spacing, and typography for a cohesive and professional appearance across all pages.  
- **Accessibility** – Ensuring WCAG compliance, including high-contrast text, scalable font sizes, and readable typography.  
- **Clarity & Readability** – Using clear, legible fonts, adequate line spacing, and structured layouts to improve content consumption.  
- **Minimalism & Simplicity** – Removing unnecessary elements to highlight key interactions and maintain a clean, user-friendly experience.

### **Branding and Aesthetic**

Much of the Surface Plane was directly influenced by the initial meeting with Louis Cane, where the essence of Clancy Nook’s brand identity was explored. During this discussion, a thematic direction rooted in storytelling, history, mystery, and intrigue was established, forming the core of Clancy Nook’s persona. These discussions guided the design choices, ensuring that every visual aspect of the website aligned with Louis’s existing branding, including logos and imagery that evoked a sense of exploration and discovery.

These images played a crucial role in reinforcing this alignment, depicting Louis Cane as Clancy Nook in his tour guide attire, embodying the Victorian-era historian and storyteller that defined his brand. This persona was not just a marketing tool but an integral part of the tour experience itself—when visitors booked a tour, they stepped into a world of curated narratives and historical insights.

<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/images/clancy-nook-about.webp" alt="Clancy Nook Profile Icon on Social Media" width="200">
</div>

### **Color Palette**

Color was essential for branding, navigation, and user interaction. The website’s palette balanced historical authenticity with modern usability and accessibility. Inspired by Clancy Nook’s branding and Louis Cane’s tour guide persona, the aesthetic reflected Victorian-era storytelling, emphasizing mystery, heritage, and exploration.  

To ensure the selected colors met both branding and accessibility requirements, _Adobe Color_ was used to extract a historically resonant yet web-friendly palette. This tool enabled the derivation of primary and secondary hues from key brand imagery, ensuring visual coherence across all design elements.  

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/color-palette.webp" alt="Clancy Nook color palette" width="600">
</div>

The WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines required a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text to ensure accessibility. Additionally, WCAG 2.1 mandated a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for graphics and user interface components, such as form input borders, ensuring key functional elements were easily distinguishable. For an even higher level of accessibility, WCAG Level AAA required a 7:1 ratio for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text, benefiting users with more severe visual impairments.

To ensure the Clancy Nook website met these accessibility standards, I tested various color combinations using _Contrast Checker_. This analysis allowed me to determine which color pairings were suitable for different design elements.

1. **High-contrast combinations** (4.5:1 or higher) were reserved for body text and critical information to maximize readability.
2. **Moderate contrast ratios** (3:1 - 4.5:1) were used for larger text elements, such as headings and section titles.
3. **Lower contrast colors** that do not meet accessibility thresholds for text were applied to decorative or background elements, ensuring they do not interfere with readability.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/color-contrast-checker.webp" alt="Clancy Nook color contrast validation" width="600">
</div>

The background color for the website was set to Cream (#F3EED8) to provide a warm, neutral base that ensured readability without overwhelming users. Dark Brown (#3C331C) was chosen for the primary text color, as it maintained a contrast ratio above 4.5:1 against the cream background, meeting accessibility standards for normal text. This pairing ensured that content remained legible across various devices and lighting conditions.

For key navigational elements and interactive components, Dark Blue (#2B4A4A) was selected as the navbar background with Cream (#F3EED8) text, ensuring an at least 7:1 contrast ratio, compliant with WCAG AAA standards.

Accent colors were incorporated to highlight interactive elements without sacrificing accessibility.

- **Caramel (#EDC479)** served as a warm highlight color, providing contrast in call-to-action elements and the footer background.
- **Light Blue (#7EA5A2)** added a cooler accent for visual balance, applied in secondary design elements such as cards and form backgrounds.

The final palette was tested using _Chroma Tool_ for deuteranopia (red-green deficiency), protanopia (red blindness), and tritanopia (blue-yellow deficiency). This ensured that all critical UI elements maintained clear visual contrast across different types of color blindness. This commitment to accessibility aligned with WCAG 2.1 best practices, reinforcing readability and usability for a diverse audience.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/color-colorblind-safe-checker.webp" alt="Clancy Nook color contrast validation" width="600">
</div>

### **Typography**
When designing the Clancy Nook website, I aimed to replicate the original typography used in the Clancy Nook Facebook banner. However, as the exact font was unknown, I turned to _Google Fonts_ to find a close match. After thorough exploration, I selected IM Fell Double Pica, a historically inspired serif font that aligned with the brand’s heritage-driven aesthetic.

IM Fell Double Pica offered several advantages:

1. **Legibility**
   - Moderate x-height and well-proportioned letterforms improve clarity.
   - Sufficient spacing between characters enhances readability.
   - Clear differentiation between characters prevents misinterpretation.
2. **Readability**
   - Works well for long text passages, maintaining a comfortable reading flow.
   - Suitable for captions and digital displays, preserving clarity even in smaller sizes.
3. **Visual Fatigue & Adaptability**
   - While its traditional design can lead to visual fatigue in extensive reading, limiting its use to headings and navigational elements ensures a balanced user experience.
   - Adaptable across different devices and languages, maintaining legibility and aesthetic appeal.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/im-fell-double-pica.webp" alt="Clancy Nook secondary font for headers" width="600">
</div>

This font is exclusively used for headings and navigation, and to optimize readability, it is applied in UPPERCASE. This decision was made to reinforce Clancy Nook’s historical aesthetic while ensuring that text remains legible and impactful, providing:

- Improved clarity  
- Enhanced visibility in navigation  
- Stronger branding presence  

To complement IM Fell Double Pica’s ornate, old-world feel, I used _FontForge_ to identify a modern, highly readable sans-serif for body text. Montserrat was chosen for its clarity, versatility, and strong visual contrast, ensuring seamless readability without detracting from Clancy Nook’s period-inspired branding.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/font-pairing.webp" alt="Clancy Nook font-pairing" width="600">
</div>

Montserrat offers several key benefits:

1. **Legibility**
   - A clean and crisp design ensures clear character differentiation, even at small sizes.
   - A generous x-height improves clarity, making it easier to distinguish similar letters.
   - Well-spaced letterforms contribute to optimal readability in diverse text settings.
3. **Readability**
   - Works well for long text passages, captions, and digital displays.
   - Ensures consistent clarity across devices, preventing strain in prolonged reading sessions.
   - Its modern aesthetic makes it highly effective for both digital and print media.
4. **Visual Fatigue & Adaptability**
   - Montserrat’s design minimizes visual fatigue, making it suitable for extensive reading.
   - Adaptable across various devices, screen resolutions, and languages, ensuring a universal reading experience.
   - Its multiple font weights allow for hierarchical structuring of content, guiding users seamlessly through the site.

</div>

### **Imagery**
Visual storytelling played a crucial role in shaping the Clancy Nook website, immersing users in rich historical narratives while enhancing engagement. Carefully curated imagery, subtle overlays, shadows, and dynamic elements worked together to create an authentic and visually compelling experience.

#### Hero Banners
Hero images served as focal points across the website, immediately setting the tone for visitors. These visually striking elements were positioned near the top of pages, often spanning the full width. They provided visitors with an immediate introduction to the brand while shaping their first impression and overall user experience.

An effective hero image should:

- Capture attention instantly  
- Visually communicate the brand’s value proposition  
- Guide users toward relevant content or actions  

The homepage hero image, featuring a historical Manchester street in Ancoats, was designed with complementary colors to draw users into the site. A semi-transparent overlay was applied to these images, ensuring text readability while preserving the atmospheric depth and vintage aesthetic.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/hero-banner-homepage.webp" alt="Clancy Nook homepage hero banner" width="200">
</div>

The hero image for the Tours page captured the intrigue of Clancy Nook’s storytelling. A moody Manchester street scene in the city center was selected, featuring the same overlay to maintain visual consistency and enhance the immersive experience.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/figures/hero-banner-tour-page.webp" alt="Clancy Nook tour page hero banner" width="200">
</div>

#### Backgrounds
Throughout the site, full-width background images complemented key pages, such as the reviews and contact page. They provided a strong sensory connection to the service being offered without overwhelming the content. Light blue was selected as the background for the sectional elements containing content, such as the review cards and contact form, ensuring accessibility for all users.

Key considerations for background imagery:  
- High-resolution & optimal sizing (< 2048px x 1536px)  
- Brand alignment & authenticity  
- Readability & accessibility  
- CSS implementation & responsiveness  
- Static backgrounds for immersion  
- Performance optimization  

The reviews page featured a historic building with ornate windows and an external fire escape, reinforcing Clancy Nook’s connection to Manchester’s industrial and architectural heritage. The design ensured that user testimonials remained the focal point while maintaining visual harmony, using a light blue overlay on the review cards.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/images/background-image-reviews.webp" alt="Clancy Nook reviews page background image" width="200">
</div>

The contact page background featured the Thirsty Scholar pub, a well-known Manchester landmark, directly linking to the city's vibrant history and Clancy Nook’s tour locations. The consistent light blue overlay was applied with slight transparency, while opaque, muted cream input fields provided subtle contrast. This design choice created a vintage yet accessible feel, ensuring both usability and aesthetic cohesion.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/images/background-image-contact.webp" alt="Clancy Nook contact page background image" width="200">
</div>

#### Black & White Imagery
The Clancy Nook website incorporated historical imagery from the Manchester Local Image Collection, a public domain archive documenting the city's evolution. These black-and-white photographs of Victorian streets, industrial districts, and historic landmarks established a strong sense of place and authenticity, immersing users in the setting before they even stepped onto a tour.

Black and White Images in Web Design:  
- Lessened distractions  
- Offered a minimal aesthetic  
- Provided a sophisticated look  
- Focused on light, form, and texture  
- Did not detract from the color palette  

This approach aligned with Clancy Nook’s historical branding, which was drawn heavily from Victorian-era newspaper reports from the 1800s and early 1900s. This choice evoked the feel of archival materials and historical publications, reinforcing the tours’ connection to the past.

<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/images/a-tale-of-two-cities-tour-2.webp" alt="Photograph of city centre from Manchester Local Image Collection" width="500">
</div>

Additionally, group photos taken by tourists were been edited into black and white to maintain visual consistency across the website. These images, originally shared by visitors, were used with full consent for business purposes, ensuring that prospective customers see real tour experiences while preserving the historical aesthetic.

<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/images/private-bookings-tour-3.webp" alt="Photograph of tour group on Ancoats Tour" width="500">
</div>

#### Carousels
To enhance user engagement and create an interactive experience, the tours page featured image carousels, allowing visitors to scroll through a curated selection of historical and contemporary images. These carousels visually previewed key locations, historical sites, and moments from past tours, striking a balance between historical authenticity and modern storytelling.

NN/g UX Experts suggest carousels should:  
- Include 5 or fewer frames  
- Ensure that navigation controls appear inside the frame  
- Use crisp-looking images  

The carousel format was chosen to keep the page structured and visually engaging while avoiding excessive imagery that might overwhelm the Tours page layout. This ensured a smooth user experience, allowing visitors to explore different aspects of each tour at their own pace.

<div align="center">
   <img src="docs/images/carousel-example.webp" alt="Photograph of tour group on Ancoats Tour" width="600">
</div>

#### Gallery
The gallery page was intentionally the most colorful and visually rich section of the website, contrasting with the muted, vintage tones used elsewhere. While other sections focused on historical authenticity with black-and-white images, the gallery embraced full-color photography, emphasizing the vibrancy and energy of the tours.

A well-designed website gallery should have:  
- High-quality, authentic images  
- Seamless layout  
- Immersive experience  
- Diverse perspectives  

The gallery prioritized high-resolution photos to maintain clarity and professionalism. The borderless, collage-style arrangement ensured that images flowed naturally, immersing visitors in the tour experience. This approach minimized visual clutter and enhanced the feeling of continuity between moments.  

A mix of candid group photos, architectural shots, and historical landmarks created a balanced visual representation, allowing potential customers to envision themselves on the tour, engaging with the locations and narratives.  

Most images in the gallery were taken by Louis Cane or were shared by tourists with explicit consent for business use. To maintain transparency and ethical integrity:  

- Some images were sourced from free-use libraries, ensuring copyright compliance.  
- Third-party photos were used with permission, properly crediting contributors where needed.  
- Some photos were color-edited using _Photokit_ to match the site’s palette aesthetic.

#### Buttons
The button design across the Clancy Nook website prioritized usability, accessibility, and aesthetic consistency to maximize user experience.

To ensure clarity and usability, button design followed web accessibility and UI/UX best practices:

- **Consistent Sizing & Placement**
- **High Contrast for Readability**
- **Large Clickable Areas**
- **Clear Visual Feedback**

#### Call-to-Actin Buttons
These buttons maintained uniform spacing and dimensions across pages, improving clickability on both desktop and mobile. Text was always easily legible, avoiding low-contrast combinations. Buttons had ample padding, making them easy to tap on mobile devices.

- **Light Buttons**: A cream background with dark serif typography, maintaining readability and an elegant vintage feel.  
- **Dark Buttons**: A deep green background with contrasting cream text, offering an alternative for varied visual appeal.

Both button types changed to a warm caramel tone upon hover or interaction. This aligned with the call-to-action overlays and footer, reinforcing branding consistency.

### **Core Features** (4.1)
#### **Navbar**

The navbar is the main navigation tool on the website, allowing users to quickly access different pages. It appears at the top of every page and includes links to the Home, About, Tours, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact sections.

The navbar ensures visitors can easily move between different parts of the site. On larger screens, the menu is displayed across the top of the page, while on smaller screens, it collapses into a hamburger menu, which expands when tapped. This keeps the interface clean and uncluttered on mobile devices.

- The logo is positioned on the left and also functions as a home button.
- The navigation links are displayed in a row on large screens but are hidden in a dropdown menu on smaller screens.
- A dedicated contact button makes it easy for users to reach out, standing out from the other links.
- A smooth scrolling feature has been added, ensuring that when users click a link to an in-page section, they are taken there in a seamless motion rather than a sudden jump.
- On mobile, once a user clicks a menu item, the dropdown automatically collapses, making it more user-friendly.
- The navbar uses fixed-top, meaning it remains visible as users scroll, making navigation more accessible.
