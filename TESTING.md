# **Testing**

Testing is a crucial phase in web development that ensures the functionality, usability, and overall performance of a website. This document covers various aspects of manual testing, including responsiveness, browser compatibility, user stories and features. Automated testing was also used to ensure code quality, with HTML and CSS validators checking adherence to web standards. Website performance and SEO was evaluated, while accessibility testing ensured compliance with standards for an inclusive user experience.

## **Manual Testing**

Manual testing was a critical part of the Clancy Nook Project, ensuring that all features functioned correctly and provided a seamless user experience. Testing was conducted throughout the entire development process, incorporating real-time adjustments and refinements.

A combination of DevTools, BrowserStack, and WAVE was used to conduct thorough testing:

- _DevTools_ allowed for in-depth inspection of responsive design, element behavior, and debugging across multiple screen sizes.

- _BrowserStack_ enabled cross-browser compatibility testing, making it possible to simulate older browser versions and various operating systems.

- Regular deployment through _GitHub_ allowed for frequent testing iterations, making it easier to catch and address issues early in the development process.

### **Responsiveness**

To ensure that the website adapts properly across different screen sizes and devices, manual testing was conducted using available physical devices at the time, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops, as well as _DevTools_ in modern web browsers. 

Developer tools allowed for an extended range of responsiveness testing by simulating multiple screen resolutions beyond the available physical devices. This enabled testing for various breakpoints, ensuring the design adapts well to different viewport sizes, including those not physically available for testing.

The table below presents the results of the responsiveness testing, detailing how the site performs across various devices. Key aspects tested include:

- Layout adjustments for different screen sizes.
- Proper display of images and links.
- Consistency in rendering across different devices.

### **Browser Compatibility**

To ensure the website functions and appears consistently across different web browsers, manual and automated testing was conducted. This process involved testing on physical devices, as well as using a trial of _BrowserStack_, a cloud-based testing platform that allows for compatibility testing across a wide range of browsers, including versions not available on local machines.

Using BrowserStack was beneficial for:

- Verifying cross-platform consistency across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, and mobile browsers).
- Identifying rendering inconsistencies that may not appear in a single development environment.

The table below presents the results of the browser compatibility testing, detailing how the core features performed across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.

### **User Stories**

To validate that the website meets user needs, a user stories testing phase was conducted. The user stories and their corresponding acceptance criteria had been developed throughout the project using GitHub's issue tracking system to ensure a structured approach.

For testing, the user stories table was shared with ten individuals who represented a diverse group in terms of computing knowledge. This included users with varying levels of technical proficiency, from casual web users to those with more advanced digital skills.

This approach was crucial for testing because:

- Users with limited technical knowledge helped identify issues with usability and intuitive navigation.
- More users could assess technical aspects such as functionality and efficiency.
- A diverse group provided varied feedback, ensuring the website catered to a broad audience, including tourists, locals, and corporate clients.

Each participant tested the website against the acceptance criteria outlined for each user story. They were asked to:

- Navigate the website as they would if they were genuinely looking to book a tour.
- Check accessibility to ensure that information was easy to find and understand.
- Attempt key actions, such as booking a tour, submitting a contact form, or reading reviews.
- Provide feedback on usability, responsiveness, and whether the acceptance criteria were met.

The results of the user stories testing are documented in the table below, showing whether each story passed or failed based on real user interactions.

|User Story                                                                                                                                 |Priority|Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Pass or Fail|

### **Features Testing**

Due to the scale of the website and the number of interactive elements, feature testing was conducted manually, primarily by myself. This allowed for a thorough and detailed review of each component, ensuring functionality, responsiveness, and consistency.

To perform this testing, I:

- Manually navigated the website across different pages, testing all interactive elements.
- Resized the browser window to check responsiveness and layout adjustments.
- Interacted with forms, buttons, and hover effects to ensure expected behavior.
- Verified links and redirections to ensure all navigation elements function correctly.
- Checked animations and hover effects to confirm smooth and visually consistent interactions.

The following table summarizes the expected outcomes, testing performed, and results for each feature tested on the website.
